2021-07-04:Nancy Pelosi was visiting a primary school in Atlanta and visited a grade four clas(s).  They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asked Mrs. Pelosi if she would like to lead the discussion on the word 'tragedy.' So our illustrious Democrat asked the clas(s) for an example of a 'tragedy'. One little boy stood up and offered: "If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs him over and kills him, that would be a tragedy. ""No," said Pelosi , "that would be an accident. "A little girl raised her hand: "If a school bus carrying 50 children drove off a cliff, killing everyone, that would be a tragedy. ""I'm afraid not," explained Pelosi ."That's what we would call great loss. "The room went silent. No other child volunteered. Pelosi searched the room. "Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? "Finally at the back of the room, Little Johnny raised his hand. The teacher held her breath. In a quiet voice he said: "If the plane carrying you was struck by a 'friendly fire' missile and blown to smithereens that would be a tragedy. ""Fantastic!" exclaimed Pelosi , "That's right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy? ""Well," says Johnny, "It has to be a tragedy, because it sure as hell wouldn't be a great loss ... and you can bet your sweet #$%$ it wouldn't be an accident either!"
2021-07-04:I’m investing into Apple now. I’m thinking if they come up with a cool car in the next few years, I’ll use my profits to buy such car :)
2021-07-04:$SQ $AAPL $WIMI Come on, stay calm together tomorrow.🚀🚀🚀
2021-07-03:I can confidently say aapl will go year high by next Friday!It is very cheap and big boys are buying by the tons.
2021-07-03:I am highly optimistic of apple for the next one year, Appl venturing into cars and its deal it taiwan semi conductors.. all of it is going to play a major role.
2021-07-03:16 days ago I said：”As I’ve posted before: Everyone always throwing out dumb reasons why AAPL hasn’t moved much. Stocks go through lulls all the time. AAPL had a big run up prior to split. It had its biggest quarter ever but it didn’t move. Hedge funds always watch AAPL. If it doesn’t move then they concentrate on spending money elsewhere usually riskier bets and manipulators are keeping the price low shaking out the weak investors. Then at the end of the year the stock starts to make its move usually because the quarters are good and the new products are announced. Everyone wonders why then the price action moves. When Apple starts moving up 3-5 dollars you’ll see more institutions and hedge funds pile in.”—->. CNBC a few days ago institutions were buying. Yep because the second half of the year started and Apple’s price started moving up. Institutions and hedge funds notice and start piling in on the cheap before it runs up the remaining of the year.
2021-07-03:Will it past 143-148 in the next two weeks? What do you guys think? 🤔
2021-07-03:I not sure how Apple could go about it but they need to get ipads into non apple users hands.Anyone who needs power and speed already owns a mac,but regular joes that are still using samsung or other tablets just dont know how much more supreme ipad is.battery life,not just each charge but also year longevity,supreme apps and user friendly.also apple help line.i once had issues with my connection and had a live chat with the apple guy.waited about a minute to get the  guy online chatting and he walked me through the fix.There is nothing like an apple.Maybe apple could set up a trial which new customers get 1 -3 months free use of a used ipad.They gave me 70 bucks for my 7 year old ipad ,when i bought a new one for 400$.they could wipe out the old used ipads and loan those ones.if the ipads aren’t returned at end of trial youre credit card is dinged.sounds like a winning plan to me.
2021-07-03:Buy now before earnings while it's still dirt cheap at $140
2021-07-03:You folks better place your hopes on Apple’s existing business rather than hope for a car, etc.
2021-07-03:last sunday covid cases and deaths in usa and every day since then9000,12000,13000,17000,17300,18400131,154,321,294,317,322summary.   2+ times cases2.5+ times deathsadd july 4th crowds and no masks+ 3 more weeks= 60000 +daily cases and 1000 deaths per day.dont be stupid wear your mask.If you dont,Apple will hit 200 by october,and alot of brain dead Americans will vanish.
2021-07-03:MRIN $1.32 last week $22 now $10,000 would have gotten you $200,000. I love APPL but you don't buy and hold anymore.
2021-07-03:Happy Birthday USA! GLTA.
2021-07-03:Next week aapl closing $145.00.Who is with me?
2021-07-03:I am glad I was able to pick up a lot of shares of Apple while it was trading sideways for the last 9 months. This stock will trade higher by the end of the year. The king is back. Can't go wrong with this stock or QQQ. GLTA
2021-07-03:Tim Cook has a surprise coming - AAPL going higher. GLTA, Happy 4th.
2021-07-03:Like I said a week or two ago. Every piker on cnbc will start recommending 🍏 after the stock rallies 15 % or so.
2021-07-03:Guess what ladies and gentlemen.I will not say another word here until earnings
2021-07-03:Must run past $146 otherwise it risks the headwind of  a "double top"
2021-07-03:Fun fact, The 100 million shares that are currently shorted are worth about $14 billion. Apple has been buying back more than that in one ONE QUARTER based on the size of their previous buybacks. "The more you know...." as they say. I honestly don't know how shorts can sleep at night. They must certainly be nervous insomiacs lol. Why would you try to short Apple? It is like throwing your money away.
2021-07-03:It is time!
2021-07-03:Sadly the "baby steps" has been thrown out the window with the baby. There is no controlling "momentum".Earnings are a month away - Aug 3.Everyone should have a plan and be disciplined with it.Have a great holiday weekend
2021-07-03:WE posted $139 next week.Why was this surprising?July 09 calls:AAPL210709C00136000...	2021-07-02 3:59PM EDT...	136.00...	4.11	4.10	4.20	+2.01...	+95.71%	AAPL210709C00137000...	2021-07-02 3:59PM EDT...	137.00...	3.25	3.20	3.30	+1.80...	+124.14%	AAPL210709C00138000...	2021-07-02 3:59PM EDT...	138.00...	2.45	2.39	2.50	+1.48...	+152.58%	AAPL210709C00139000...	2021-07-02 3:59PM EDT...	139.00...	1.70	1.69	1.76	+1.07...	+169.84%
2021-07-03:WE were wrong yet we wrongWE apologize.WE will try harder
2021-07-03:Friday's volume was 50% higher than Thursday's.Maybe that Technical "$137.11 is the buy-in" is true
2021-07-03:THe Beauty of Da Vinci, REnoir and Van Gough strategies!Da Vinci:  First trading day of2021, AAPL opened at $132, The Jan 22 $130 calls sold for $20. Yesterday the stock is $140- and the Jan 22 balls are $16.40. The stock has ran $8 and these calls are down $3.50. OF course, earlier in the year, when they fell below $10 it was suggested to close these out for $10 profit and sell the Jan 23 calls for another $20+; putting $30 cash in one's pocket with a cost basis of $130 and a giveaway of $160. Renoir: This daily algorithm play on a weekly basis has made triple digit returns once and sometimes twice.Van Gogh: Selling puts every time AAPL dipped 15% was a home run.In conclusion. The Three Musketeers are not the Three Stogies.
2021-07-03:AAPL still has a lot of room to run when compared to other faang stocks like google and one that isn't faang like MSFT and other growth companies. AAPL and AMZN have stayed flat all year and are the best in FAANG to keep running past all time highs. 1 yr chart on AAPL still looks flat. the run up has just started and is still early. With earnings run ups I can see this at 155 to 160 and whatever happens to earnings happens because no one knows but I can see AAPL at those prices before earnings

2021-07-02:Just a short few weeks ago, these were the postings and you know who you are!Too many outstanding shares.,should not have split.more sellers than buyers.the company no longer innovates. Its the Epic lawsuit.we needs car news. Its Tim Cook. chip shortage. not enough dividend. Let me know if I missed anything?

2021-07-02:Happy July 4th to all Apple investors whether you're in it for the long term or short term.

2021-07-02:Folks we're a measly $5 away from the ATH. Apple has succeeded to claw it's way back from pandemic desolation. Be happy if you are long. You've been patient and you will be rewarded. Very satisfying.
2021-07-02:Apple iCar commeth.  For those of you who say “It’s a mistake.  Automotive is low profit,” I’ve got something for youuuu.   This car, this very special car, isn’t just being built to cart your hides to the grocery store.  It is being built to occupy the remaining part of your day, the time you don’t spend on your phone or computer.  During this time, Apple will hook you deeper into their ecosystem.  Big money subscriptions.  Big profits.
2021-07-02:Bought 5,420 Apple shares at 24.85 in 2016 for a cost of $134,687.............Those shares are now worth $758,583......Patience is a virtue, kids.
2021-07-02:Really? Ya couldn’t do 140? it only took 8 months since the split
2021-07-02:What does Apple sell?
2021-07-02:Apple’s next massive new product release won’t be a car (although that will happen). It will be an AR product (augmented realty) A TAM ( total addressable market) in the trillions. Expect a headset in 2022 and glasses in 2023. Apple is the clear leader in AR followed by Facebook. 😎
2021-07-02:A message to "Rd":You posted July 1 that Apple could hit $140 on July 2.I scoffed.Apple hit $140 today!Props to you...
2021-07-02:I bought back 5 deep in the money covered calls last week. Maybe, it was a good move.
2021-07-02:Thank you Eddie for making me feel comfortable enough to add 200 more shares three weeks ago.I wish there were more like you who can say why to buy instead of the pumpers here who just make me nervous.
2021-07-02:Momentum, Momentum, Momentum!AAPL will Run now as in the past 12 years.Stocks always over run and over sell-off.Any attempt to reign it in rarely works.
2021-07-02:This bum is overvalued, omg P/FCF so high.  The game is about to be over and the crying time will begin.
2021-07-02:Up $15 in last month and just getting started. Will take a serious run at the vaunted $200 number by year’s end IMHO 😎
2021-07-02:I think it's going to rain really big this weekend, considering how Apple the oinker stock went this whole week without going down once.  Amazing!
