2021-07-04:Nancy Pelosi was visiting a primary school in Atlanta and visited a grade four clas(s).  They were in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asked Mrs. Pelosi if she would like to lead the discussion on the word 'tragedy.' So our illustrious Democrat asked the clas(s) for an example of a 'tragedy'. One little boy stood up and offered: "If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs him over and kills him, that would be a tragedy. ""No," said Pelosi , "that would be an accident. "A little girl raised her hand: "If a school bus carrying 50 children drove off a cliff, killing everyone, that would be a tragedy. ""I'm afraid not," explained Pelosi ."That's what we would call great loss. "The room went silent. No other child volunteered. Pelosi searched the room. "Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? "Finally at the back of the room, Little Johnny raised his hand. The teacher held her breath. In a quiet voice he said: "If the plane carrying you was struck by a 'friendly fire' missile and blown to smithereens that would be a tragedy. ""Fantastic!" exclaimed Pelosi , "That's right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy? ""Well," says Johnny, "It has to be a tragedy, because it sure as hell wouldn't be a great loss ... and you can bet your sweet #$%$ it wouldn't be an accident either!"
2021-07-04:I’m investing into Apple now. I’m thinking if they come up with a cool car in the next few years, I’ll use my profits to buy such car :)
2021-07-04:$SQ $AAPL $WIMI Come on, stay calm together tomorrow.🚀🚀🚀
2021-07-03:I can confidently say aapl will go year high by next Friday!It is very cheap and big boys are buying by the tons.
2021-07-03:I am highly optimistic of apple for the next one year, Appl venturing into cars and its deal it taiwan semi conductors.. all of it is going to play a major role.
2021-07-03:16 days ago I said：”As I’ve posted before: Everyone always throwing out dumb reasons why AAPL hasn’t moved much. Stocks go through lulls all the time. AAPL had a big run up prior to split. It had its biggest quarter ever but it didn’t move. Hedge funds always watch AAPL. If it doesn’t move then they concentrate on spending money elsewhere usually riskier bets and manipulators are keeping the price low shaking out the weak investors. Then at the end of the year the stock starts to make its move usually because the quarters are good and the new products are announced. Everyone wonders why then the price action moves. When Apple starts moving up 3-5 dollars you’ll see more institutions and hedge funds pile in.”—->. CNBC a few days ago institutions were buying. Yep because the second half of the year started and Apple’s price started moving up. Institutions and hedge funds notice and start piling in on the cheap before it runs up the remaining of the year.
2021-07-03:Will it past 143-148 in the next two weeks? What do you guys think? 🤔
2021-07-03:I not sure how Apple could go about it but they need to get ipads into non apple users hands.Anyone who needs power and speed already owns a mac,but regular joes that are still using samsung or other tablets just dont know how much more supreme ipad is.battery life,not just each charge but also year longevity,supreme apps and user friendly.also apple help line.i once had issues with my connection and had a live chat with the apple guy.waited about a minute to get the  guy online chatting and he walked me through the fix.There is nothing like an apple.Maybe apple could set up a trial which new customers get 1 -3 months free use of a used ipad.They gave me 70 bucks for my 7 year old ipad ,when i bought a new one for 400$.they could wipe out the old used ipads and loan those ones.if the ipads aren’t returned at end of trial youre credit card is dinged.sounds like a winning plan to me.
2021-07-03:Buy now before earnings while it's still dirt cheap at $140
2021-07-03:You folks better place your hopes on Apple’s existing business rather than hope for a car, etc.
2021-07-03:last sunday covid cases and deaths in usa and every day since then9000,12000,13000,17000,17300,18400131,154,321,294,317,322summary.   2+ times cases2.5+ times deathsadd july 4th crowds and no masks+ 3 more weeks= 60000 +daily cases and 1000 deaths per day.dont be stupid wear your mask.If you dont,Apple will hit 200 by october,and alot of brain dead Americans will vanish.
2021-07-03:MRIN $1.32 last week $22 now $10,000 would have gotten you $200,000. I love APPL but you don't buy and hold anymore.
2021-07-03:Happy Birthday USA! GLTA.
2021-07-03:Next week aapl closing $145.00.Who is with me?
2021-07-03:I am glad I was able to pick up a lot of shares of Apple while it was trading sideways for the last 9 months. This stock will trade higher by the end of the year. The king is back. Can't go wrong with this stock or QQQ. GLTA
2021-07-03:Tim Cook has a surprise coming - AAPL going higher. GLTA, Happy 4th.
2021-07-03:Like I said a week or two ago. Every piker on cnbc will start recommending 🍏 after the stock rallies 15 % or so.
2021-07-03:Guess what ladies and gentlemen.I will not say another word here until earnings
2021-07-03:Must run past $146 otherwise it risks the headwind of  a "double top"
2021-07-03:Fun fact, The 100 million shares that are currently shorted are worth about $14 billion. Apple has been buying back more than that in one ONE QUARTER based on the size of their previous buybacks. "The more you know...." as they say. I honestly don't know how shorts can sleep at night. They must certainly be nervous insomiacs lol. Why would you try to short Apple? It is like throwing your money away.
2021-07-03:It is time!
2021-07-03:Sadly the "baby steps" has been thrown out the window with the baby. There is no controlling "momentum".Earnings are a month away - Aug 3.Everyone should have a plan and be disciplined with it.Have a great holiday weekend
2021-07-03:WE posted $139 next week.Why was this surprising?July 09 calls:AAPL210709C00136000...	2021-07-02 3:59PM EDT...	136.00...	4.11	4.10	4.20	+2.01...	+95.71%	AAPL210709C00137000...	2021-07-02 3:59PM EDT...	137.00...	3.25	3.20	3.30	+1.80...	+124.14%	AAPL210709C00138000...	2021-07-02 3:59PM EDT...	138.00...	2.45	2.39	2.50	+1.48...	+152.58%	AAPL210709C00139000...	2021-07-02 3:59PM EDT...	139.00...	1.70	1.69	1.76	+1.07...	+169.84%
2021-07-03:WE were wrong yet we wrongWE apologize.WE will try harder
2021-07-03:Friday's volume was 50% higher than Thursday's.Maybe that Technical "$137.11 is the buy-in" is true
2021-07-03:THe Beauty of Da Vinci, REnoir and Van Gough strategies!Da Vinci:  First trading day of2021, AAPL opened at $132, The Jan 22 $130 calls sold for $20. Yesterday the stock is $140- and the Jan 22 balls are $16.40. The stock has ran $8 and these calls are down $3.50. OF course, earlier in the year, when they fell below $10 it was suggested to close these out for $10 profit and sell the Jan 23 calls for another $20+; putting $30 cash in one's pocket with a cost basis of $130 and a giveaway of $160. Renoir: This daily algorithm play on a weekly basis has made triple digit returns once and sometimes twice.Van Gogh: Selling puts every time AAPL dipped 15% was a home run.In conclusion. The Three Musketeers are not the Three Stogies.
2021-07-03:AAPL still has a lot of room to run when compared to other faang stocks like google and one that isn't faang like MSFT and other growth companies. AAPL and AMZN have stayed flat all year and are the best in FAANG to keep running past all time highs. 1 yr chart on AAPL still looks flat. the run up has just started and is still early. With earnings run ups I can see this at 155 to 160 and whatever happens to earnings happens because no one knows but I can see AAPL at those prices before earnings

2021-07-02:Folks we're a measly $5 away from the ATH. Apple has succeeded to claw it's way back from pandemic desolation. Be happy if you are long. You've been patient and you will be rewarded. Very satisfying.
2021-07-02:Apple iCar commeth.  For those of you who say “It’s a mistake.  Automotive is low profit,” I’ve got something for youuuu.   This car, this very special car, isn’t just being built to cart your hides to the grocery store.  It is being built to occupy the remaining part of your day, the time you don’t spend on your phone or computer.  During this time, Apple will hook you deeper into their ecosystem.  Big money subscriptions.  Big profits.
2021-07-02:Bought 5,420 Apple shares at 24.85 in 2016 for a cost of $134,687.............Those shares are now worth $758,583......Patience is a virtue, kids.
2021-07-02:Really? Ya couldn’t do 140? it only took 8 months since the split
2021-07-02:What does Apple sell?
2021-07-02:Apple’s next massive new product release won’t be a car (although that will happen). It will be an AR product (augmented realty) A TAM ( total addressable market) in the trillions. Expect a headset in 2022 and glasses in 2023. Apple is the clear leader in AR followed by Facebook. 😎
2021-07-02:A message to "Rd":You posted July 1 that Apple could hit $140 on July 2.I scoffed.Apple hit $140 today!Props to you...
2021-07-02:I bought back 5 deep in the money covered calls last week. Maybe, it was a good move.
2021-07-02:Thank you Eddie for making me feel comfortable enough to add 200 more shares three weeks ago.I wish there were more like you who can say why to buy instead of the pumpers here who just make me nervous.
2021-07-02:Momentum, Momentum, Momentum!AAPL will Run now as in the past 12 years.Stocks always over run and over sell-off.Any attempt to reign it in rarely works.
2021-07-02:This bum is overvalued, omg P/FCF so high.  The game is about to be over and the crying time will begin.
2021-07-02:Up $15 in last month and just getting started. Will take a serious run at the vaunted $200 number by year’s end IMHO 😎
2021-07-02:I think it's going to rain really big this weekend, considering how Apple the oinker stock went this whole week without going down once.  Amazing!

2021-07-02:A few weeks ago at $125, after watching this thing trade sideways for 9 months, I trimmed my position by 1/3 to buy other stocks. I just did the math. I would have been better off holding.

2021-07-02:Why is everyone on this board saying to sell but you go to another board and they are all excited because they believe Apple is going to shoot up after this financial report they are going to release. This is very confusing. Is there anyone on this board that can give a legitimate, intelligent, informative answer? I’m also watching the ameritrade channel and they are all about Apple and Spotify. They are doing something together that’s going to provide telecommute services to home employees or something along that line. They are saying very bullish which still confuses me. Which is better the bear or bull? I would think a bear could mess a bull up. Oh well I just got into this.

2021-07-02:I read on another board that Apple exceeded their Q3 projections by 20%. On the board they are saying it will hit 160 by tomorrow and to hurry and buy options or shares before end of the day today.  Because end of day they are supposed to release their financials and will announce it then? If that’s true will it really go that high? Should I wait to get options or shares until tomorrow when I know for sure? I’m new to all this and I don’t want to miss out on this opportunity if it really is an opportunity. Anyone that can give me their opinion or some advise. I don’t want to miss out and the options are already starting to climb in price!  Thanks everyone.
2021-07-02:Hitting all time highs next week folks! Yes!

Avg upside now is 15.5%.   6/30 per IBD MarketSmith Apple stock hit a buy point of 137.17 out of a cup base.   This could be a huge week if the volume picks up and they easily clear buypoint.

2021-07-01:I sold my share count back to 10,000 shares. I can't believe a few short weeks ago I picked up a boatload at 123 and change. I am hoping that we can get a "bear trap" going and the stock goes down to 130. I think I will pull out the reserves and buy 1200 shares and watch it rise to 145. Can I ring the cash register one more time before people realize that Apple is the stock to own?
2021-07-01:140 tomorrow ?

2021-07-01:I love Apple- best stock i have. And knowing it cost me 0.57 per share back in the day make me want to shout. 180.00/share would be nice.
2021-07-01:Held 137 on eod rally.day traders bought in at eod,which is unusual and only done when big events are the next day (buy the rumor,sell the news thing)jobs report needs to be 700000 or less,not 1 million or more,this shows market that tapering wont be talked about in near future.wage growth will be up for sure around .5% is acceptable but higher than 1% is a problem for markets it shows that wage inflation is gaining traction.once wages rise you cant pull them back,higher  wages ,mean  companies raise prices  to pay them.all this gives companies pricing power which boosts inflation into being non transitory .unemployment  rate going up with jobs report near 700000 is best news we can get as it shows more people are looking for work,which is what markets are looking for.job openings next week is the next possible market mover if it drops into 8 million range.GLTA.HAPPY TRADING.
2021-07-01:I hope that when apple car comes out,apple splits the ev parts of the company off and gives existing share holders a slice of new stock.let the ev side run up on its own merits,not be tied to the parent company.this will give the ev part the best chance to shine.

2021-07-01:Pump & dump - headed back to the 120’s
2021-07-01:If this thing doesn’t kick it in gear soon I’m not sure I’m going to hold much longer.  Too many high growth companies exploding upwards, much better picks.  Missing out on some extraordinary gains.  Patience… patience.
2021-07-01:is it today selling or buying???

2021-07-01:Technical ominous breakdown occured.  It could not gain buy point 137.  Will retest 125
2021-07-01:why apple is down are we going down or What???
2021-07-01:First there is no bubble (in the stocks market)Secondly never use technical analysis, fortune teller or economist/strategist forecast,Last but not least never forget that stocks markets are highly inefficient in the short term, highly efficient in the long term.You’re welcome ☺️ Therefore, Apple will go much higher.
2021-07-01:The 10 year yield is up 2%. Everyone is panic selling .
2021-07-01:$135.03 is NOT critical.$126.62 is critical today.
2021-07-01:apple's final peak was 137.41. sell now.  it was going up on anemic volume.
2021-07-01:Ain't going nowhere on an up day...as per the usual
2021-07-01:Bah if these buildings were build per code in florida regardless pre Andrew or not they should last hundreds of years.Stop trying to reinvent the wheel here.Florida lack of regulations is why that building collapses.
2021-07-01:any time it goes down, you buy. stock market can't go down with this kind of stimulus.
2021-07-01:There are plenty of down thumbs for the nasty trolls whining about their petty grievances and carrying on about their weepy self-delusional and misinformed political thoughts. Take it somewhere else .. maybe Breitbart's web forums. This is a financial discussion forum, something to remember.
2021-07-01:AAPL will drop back to$133/134 to build the ground.The peak will be $147 at the end of Jul
2021-07-01:wrote 5 in-the-money July 30 calls. I'll get a nice profit + premiums id I lose the shares but, will still have another 500 shares left.
2021-07-01:Sell.There are still some bids above $120.
2021-07-01:I love this stock!!  I wrote many articles in detail about how Apple will go through lull's, but when it goes on runs they are legendary. Today 80% of my 1m+ Apple portfolio is pure profit!
2021-07-01:Here we go
2021-07-01:Boys and girls I think it is a down day today :(
2021-07-01:Looking at $138.  Will blow past $137
2021-07-01:As long as there are 16+ billion shares floating on the mkt to buy it will be hard for much of a move. ONE dollar up = 16 billion in value? The Co must increase their buy back, I'm sure the big institutions know when it will happen.
2021-07-01:My wife just reminded me that we have to buy new curtains for our new house (that Apple built). I told her not to worry because I bought a 1000 shares at 123 not to long ago and I still have 776 shares of left. I always keep a base of 10,000 shares that I never sell. I think I will sell 776 shares into earnings wait for the dummies to sell and then buy back in. Besides I want to go to Ireland and see the CORRS play. Apple is the best stock in the world. I have rang this stock like a cash register. I am so grateful.
2021-07-01:Volume question?Going up last few days on below than average volume?Volume	63,261,393Avg. Volume	82,668,211$139+ next week? If the trend holds!
2021-07-01:Appl is obviously a great company but we need to look for others with huge potential with BABYF. Thank me later. If you don't find it compelling bash away and give me a thumbs down.
2021-07-01:Sat at $126 for the longest time

2021-07-01:People ask why the baby steps?My question to them is "Is it working?"And it will as long as everyone is being treated equally and fairly
2021-07-01:they took a wicked dump on apple at the end of the day.  STILL were going higher
2021-07-01:Once again look at the historical  prices.The week it closed at $127 that week's intra day high was $128+, $130 the high was $132.50 and $133 and the high was $134. Yet the following week that $3+ increase happened: $127, $130, $133 and now $136.Today we are at $137+. The projected friday close is $136 this week then $139 next.WE will see
2021-07-01:APPL shares are cheap., buy them while you can.  This should easily be in the $155 range.  We will get there soon.
2021-07-01:I think we go below 135 by Fri
2021-07-01:I think foreign exchange is now the most stable investment direction
2021-07-01:I'm surprised that this oinker of stock that is Apple has gone up 3 days in a row.
2021-07-01:Chart looking good for a decent trade.
2021-07-01:The chasers and greedy will get burned and lost anytime soon in this week 's correction ahead !
2021-06-30:Hey Johnny- let’s talk about Bull spreads, bear spreads, straddles and collars.
2021-06-30:Market could plunge heavily ever tomorrow or Friday when correction due !
2021-06-30:CAUTION ! Market has reach a Selling point and it's now time for a correction / profit taking !
2021-06-30:Downgraded to sell candidate
2021-06-30:This market is a concern. Some guy who called the last two crashes said we’re due for a third one and it would make the last two look like a walk in the park.He said own no stocks. Buy real estate, gold and Bitcoin.
2021-06-30:I will ride this into earnings. If I don’t see any analysts revising their estimates up I will sell before earnings are reported. If I see some upward revision before the numbers come out I will stay.
2021-06-30:Large Apple call expiring next Friday with strike price of $135. Already have a a 65% profit looking for some advice if I should close our my position tomorrow to continuing holding to maximize more return. Any thighs for a rook?
2021-06-30:AAPL closed above April 29 high next target 145.09 resistance.
2021-06-30:looks like I am under attack for only stating I am long lots of thumbs down for that hummmm
2021-06-30:hoping for over 150 by earnings!
2021-06-30:thing is, lots of tech ran while names like Kraft Heinz and ATT fell to good entries, PMs got beat up too so... where are the gains going to be in the next month or two?
2021-06-30:looks like we are heating $140 soon i hope is not sale after profit report next month.
2021-06-30:Futures up for great start to another month. Looks like DOW 35k, Nasdaq 15k and S&P 4500. It's almost free money everyday with no pull back in sight. Last year's comps will be easy to beat. Even if Friday's jobs numbers disappointment, that means more stimulus, if they are good, then economy roaring. You can't lose with the Powell put. No where else to put your money with ultra low interest rates.
2021-06-30:Where on Yahoo Finesse do you see the estimate value of a stock price for the next year?
2021-06-30:In order for the stock to eventually reach $150, $175, $200, $250, etc one day, we must, collectively as a group, buy Apple at its current price until the ask price gets exhausted. If all goes well, with time, as the earnings increase the PE ratio will keep declining yet you'll see the stock price continuing to climb.On my end, every two weeks I've been committing about $2,500 or so to keep accumulating on my position. I've accumulated about 8,500 shares so far. I've been buying Apple and only Apple. Nothing else. 100% all in. Death before diversify. Never selling a single share. I sleep peacefully at night because I'm willing to accept all possible risks associated with this investment. I know in the long run my investment objectives will be met. Of course it brings with it many questions and unknowns. Will there be a few bad years where it could possibly tank 10, 20, 30%? Maybe. Maybe not.You want safety? You want stable returns? Invest in bonds, gold, ETFs, or mutual funds. Those will all pay you a predictable, pathetic, percentage return. I invest in Apple for the potential share price appreciation and the value that's being produced.The next 5 to 10 years is going to be a wild ride with the introduction of the Apple Car. Apple longs who stay invested will no doubt be rewarded. But can you even imagine where Apple will be in the next 20 to 25 years from now? Think about that. And think about how much has changed in the past 20 to 25 years.
2021-06-30:A few stocks I will never sell apple Amazon nvidia Microsoft tesla mara
2021-06-30:nothing technical  just long time holder
2021-06-30:Once Apple gets into hospital systems look out. Nobody is gonna care about the ancillary positions.
2021-06-30:UP $4- from Friday's close.WE did suggest Wall Street would "paint the tape".AAPL is up 8% for the month of June
2021-06-30:YTD AAPL is up 3.07% compared to returns of 80.75% 2020, 86.16% 2019, <6.79%> 2018 ( longer upgrade cycles & competition from China) & 46.11% 2017.    Avg upside now now is 15.5%.   6/30 per IBD MarketSmith Apple stock hit a buy point of 137.17 out of a cup base, according to IBD MarketSmith charts.   If volume picks up & they easily clear buypoint, this could be a huge week.   I’m all in AMZN, but tomorrow I will be “all in” AAPL.
2021-06-30:Tom Lee says buy FAANG stocks for the second half. I like it.
2021-06-30:Tom Lee says 20% rally in second half for Apple and Amazon.

2021-06-30:I’m ⬆️ close to 750% on 🍏so far.
2021-06-30:Yet another Green Day for Apple on a down day for Nasdaq. Apple keeps chopping wood as we continue heading higher. Well done Cupertino! 😎
2021-06-30:I’m with you tripple top out today next move to 144.
2021-06-30:SICK FREAKS.............SELL SELL SELL...................$110 by Thanksgiving.  This market is going to sell off about 20% before Thanksgiving.   SELL SELL SELL...................
2021-06-30:Why do analysts believe this turd will grow at 18% over next 5 years when it's only grown at 9% over the last 5 years?  AAPL is dead money for the foreseeable future.
2021-06-30:cant stop Apple
2021-06-30:solid gain today
2021-06-30:I have been long for months but decided to close out a trading position today. Stock is looking a little overbought but would not hesitate to jump back on if it retraces back to 130. It could easily go higher and I may regret my move but I booked a very nice gain so that is always good. Apple a great company and I am still long in my IRA but did close the traders today. Time will tell.
2021-06-30:Solid buying on a red day. A couple of green days will rocket this toward $150. And beyond.
2021-06-30:Will this ever get to $140 again.....pretty much has gone nowhere since the split. Lagging all other tech stocks making new highs.....AAPL needs to catch up.
2021-06-30:Rotten 🍎 can’t stay above $137
2021-06-30:Someone dumped .40 in 10 minutes!
2021-06-30:Better to sell today then wait for tomorrow when this really tanks
2021-06-30:Wake me up when it’s ATH!!
2021-06-30:Lordy, lordy, lordy. $137!

2021-06-30:Let's crack a buck 37 and make the run to a buck fifty pre-earnings!!!! Woo hoo!!!!
2021-06-30:This will not surpass $137 for sometime. Too much market-wide commotion going on. Squeeze has yet to take place with amc, gme and those alike. MMs & institutions have been naked shorting to drive prices down. amc just hit share threshold so the real fun is about to begin there. Billions in equity of faang has yet to be moved out in order to cover. This is common sense. We will sit in the $130s for many more months
2021-06-30:It broke the $135 resistance and now the resistance is $137. With almost 1 month of trading before earnings this is looking strong
2021-06-30:Truthfully I never thought we would see $136+ so easily last week.$139+ is the the goal.However it may run past $139+ because Everything I am reading says $137.11 is the technical "Buy-in" with the cup and handle etcSo, do not sell weekly covered calls once it hits $139+ next week
2021-06-30:Everyone wanted apple to buy ROKU. Now, they are buying a button on their remote. No pun intended but when you go to an apple orchard don’t you taste an apple from each tree before you decide on buying the right ones!

2021-06-30:This stock will close solid 137ish.  Friday 140's
2021-06-30:@pyrrhic victory - Thanks for the kind words earlier.  Appreciated it! Hang onto AAPL. I went in "up to my hips" a year or 3 before the 1:7 split. Have AAPL in my Sep-IRA, (2) Roth IRAs and a regular account. Cannot tell you how funny this board is. De Vinchi seems like a solid citizen... plus a few more that I appreciate.  As the Mothers of Invention said: "We're only in it for the money".
2021-06-30:Read “The Infinite Game” by Simon Sinek. In the 1st 10 pages, he has a compelling story about what makes Apple greater than Microsoft.

2021-06-29:friendly reminder that AAPL is a profitability powerhouse

2021-06-29:For the past 20yrs almost I’ve been putting almost all my money into stocks like Microsoft, Apple, and others. I’ve worked a job that payed minimum wage. 3rd shift factory jobs, and other general labor type jobs. In the 20yrs I’ve bought myself no clothes. The only new clothes I get are underwear, socks, a t shirt or two, and pants from my parents on Christmas. I live in a 1977 single wide trailer that I bought years ago for $1000. My car is a 1987 Toyota Corolla. I’ve been single for almost 15years with no children. I’ve eaten almost nothing but Ramen noodles and canned beans. I’ve not went to the dentist in years yet surprisingly I have all my teeth and no cavities that I know of. When I just checked my brokerage account a few minutes ago I have now broken the $1M mark in my account for the first time ever. I have no plans on changing my lifestyle habits. Some people think I’m crazy but this is my story.$AAPL $AMD $AMZN $AMC $GME
2021-06-29:SICK FREAKS, SELL SELL SELL.  Don't hold out for $110.....................SELL SELL SELL

2021-06-29:Fun fact: Apple repurchased $19 billion last quarter. That averages out to about $211 million in purchases per day. Own it don't trade it.
2021-06-29:Apple is in the unique position of being a defensive stock and a growth stock

2021-06-29:this is the CALM BEFORE THE STORM.  Apple was on hold to control the market for small companies catching up. most of them are where they are suppose to be now. it's time for the TECH LEADER to Move on again..  LOAD MORE OR HOLD WHAT YOU HAVE.
2021-06-29:Everyone here talking about what the price will be tomorrow, next week, next month, it’s all just noise. No one knows this stuff, and if anyone ever really did, they wouldn’t be posting it here for free because that information would be worth millions, if not billions. When it comes to apple, buy and hold is all you need to know, all you need to do.

2021-06-29:Bears in Apple stock with puts or bearish positions are becoming extinct everyday. Their carcasses will be displayed in museums next to dinosaurs to be mocked by all. Where oh where are you guys hiding? It's hunting season and the BULLS are in control now. Go look at the technical chart. If we break $137 you will see new all time highs sooner rather than later. Good luck to all longs. Diamond Hands!
2021-06-29:hot stock market. you can buy anything and make money. or just make it easy and buy MSFT, AAPL, PYPL, and FB.

2021-06-29:$400 share by 2025. Buy and hold
2021-06-29:Apple was up 82% in 2020. The top performing FAANG. As we close out the first half of 2021 Apple is up 1.5% Over a given period stocks always revert to the mean. Me thinks the second half of 2021 Apple will soar. Investors are looking for a reason to buy Apple and there is a tremendous amount of pent up demand for the stock. IMHO. 😎
2021-06-29:looks like reversal into green day today - should help $AAPL reach ATH this week
2021-06-29:The last few days a red premarket has resulted in green regular trading. Hope I didn’t jinx it by saying it, since that’s how investing works right…?  Let s go AAPL!
2021-06-29:Lets go!
2021-06-28:if apple spent 1/4 of the 90 billion to buy stock,at 126 average that will be 187 million shares off the books.with 16.67 billion shares out there,man thats not alot barely over 1%.was excited about it till i put it on paper.

2021-06-28:You make a great point, E. Edward. What right does the government have to take money from your investment profits? What right does the govt have to steal from you ?
2021-06-28:Apple to the moon. Don't speculate. Accumulate.
2021-06-28:speaking of tyrannical government. If I make a profit off my investments, why is the government entitled to a piece of it? The government didn't take the risk. And, I was already taxed on the money before I invested it. Leftists suck.
2021-06-28:AAPL opened strong and may break out tomorrow despite the Dow negative with just a little help from the 10 year dropping a bit. This lends credence to the following:"Don't try to time the market"."Apple moves when it's ready"."Own it. Don't trade it"."What was so different about today than yesterday ?"
2021-06-28:Thinking about selling my Disney stock and putting it into apple

2021-06-28:Finally and finally.. sold all AAPL... WHOooooO I'm done with it.
2021-06-28:APPLE APPL Should be at least above $250 as msft and fb records in sales and beating the market in the last two quarters in a big time and still in $130 for the whole year, I dont get it.
2021-06-28:The moral of the story: Don't automatically follow CNBC's advice.
2021-06-28:Finally sold all AAPL and I bought more AMZN and MSFT. But it has been a nice run and AAPL is a good company for sure.
2021-06-28:Longs will take it!  Baby steps

2021-06-28:End of the week 137. Next week 140. In 3 weeks 150 💪😃
2021-06-28:The Facebook ruling today should propel all tech. Government cannot possibly tell these companies to break up when the business model is intertwined.
2021-06-28:So frustrating to see FB move like this and be over valued versus Apple, but I know its going to make a move soon!
2021-06-28:Failed the 135 resistance today. we will see tomorrow. needs an upgrade or good news for that lift.
2021-06-28:buy BAP now. This bank in South america where all mines are located. The new president swear to open up investment and open market . He changed his mindset from socialism to capitalism . He realized without investment a country won't grow. His changed his ideas, so BAP have to correct. All this low was based on hedgoes manipulation to bring fear . All lies. Expect SHORT SQUEEZE soon. BAP 150 breakout will come. buy CAT too. cause they sell a lot equipment in South America where mining are. Buy TSLA is close to breAK 700. Also, ZILLOW and ABNB will climb this season Summer.
2021-06-28:Told you all to buy Facebook
2021-06-28:Apple will be over $150 by next month. I am long on Apple, which is one of the best investments I made.  Added 1000 apple shares to my portfolio today.
2021-06-28:Of course my order on $APXT didnt fill... $MSFT only going up.. same with $AAPL wow
2021-06-28:I thought about buying some of that Eddy when you posted it. I'd have been up 400% in just over 2 weeks.
2021-06-28:Look 👀 all the morons are out in full force!  What will they be saying when it breaks $150?  Wait and buy the dip?  Stupid fools
2021-06-28:I need them to go $150.
2021-06-28:Will she close above $135?  Will see
2021-06-28:For anyone buying apple, I have a suggestion.  Wait a few hours, till you get it.  I've been watching apple for a bit, and I think there is going to be a big dip in a few hours to days.  As you know though, apple will make a comeback, so be ready, it could dip at any time.  Also, I recommend using the dividends apple pays you, to invest in more fractional share of apple, that way, if you buy it at the dip, you pretty much have a money generator, and with that money you can repeat the process.
2021-06-28:Drop 30 cents unless than a minute wth
2021-06-28:we'll likely retest 139-140 by end of the week as we have now broken out of consolidation/triangle to the upside. If we break past that we will then retest ATH. HODL and grats to all bulls!
2021-06-28:Apple up as inflation expectations drop. 10y treasury hovering at lowest levels since the beginning of March which is supporting high PE multiples.
2021-06-28:Darth Vader nothing to whine about, awesome not making money and TD101 not capable to predict on geen days. That’s what I call a good day! Own 🍏 don’t trade it

2021-06-28:Cvx reversal add like a crazy person
2021-06-28:FLGT best short squeeze stock out there right now.PE ratio of 5.5.30 % short interest.
2021-06-28:Be careful we are due for 10 percent correction
2021-06-28:Fed was cutting rates in 2019 with unemployment at a 50 year low.
2021-06-28:Uh...Hold AAPL....AND, trade it....
2021-06-28:Putin called Joe B. "a potted plant".....Long AAPL
2021-06-28:Knowing this oinker of a stock that is Apple, it will go up today then spend the rest of this week going back down to $131...
2021-06-28:Nasdaq has rebounded off an at least 20% decline 118% without at least 17% correction. That has never happened in nasdaq history since 1971. Trillions in negative interest rate debt(Europe, Japan) has never happened before either
2021-06-28:Wait a minute.  A “ reputable” analyst said this was going to $80.   They lied,  say it aint so
2021-06-28:AAPL always moves up in the weeks before earnings. easy money!
2021-06-28:The only reason big tech is up is because rates are down. Economic growth rate has peaked from trillions of stimulus. There is no other alternative for cash with rates low to negative around the world other than big tech.
2021-06-28:repeat....never bet against Apple
2021-06-28:Will continue gradual upward movement in anticipation of July earnings report.
2021-06-28:u aint seen nothing yet. Imagine markets were green today Apple wouldve hit 137+ easy. DOW and SPY being red holding back tech stocks/Apple. rest of week when markets green we will ROCKET.
2021-06-28:Stock GNRC Strong
2021-06-28:Wait after Earnings… it’s heading down as usual!
2021-06-28:Today it may close around 134.5.. Still its good ..
2021-06-28:20 year holder here, still in a ho-hum mode, even though lots of you seem excited about $135. Wake me up when it fluctuates +/- 20% from the split price of $125. (So, below $104, or above $150)
2021-06-28:Stop selling at 135 we need to break resistance and then we fly
2021-06-28:Aapl and Googl are the best companies and stocks in the world!
2021-06-28:Hope it wont break 135 again..
2021-06-28:Hope to cross $200 year from now?
2021-06-28:Buy and hold apple 🍏 awesome missing out today! He’s not making money
2021-06-28:This is way past the FOMO that I was mentioning last week. Something big is going down!
2021-06-28:Looks like inflation is fading fast. Q2 is peak growth and peak inflation. Rates could plummet. Many stocks so bloated with dilution they should not be above pre covid highs.
2021-06-28:ATH this week. clean breakout after consolidation :D
2021-06-28:AAPL is the best performing FAANG stock so far today!
2021-06-28:Wondering if the ramp up to earnings has started? Usually don't see it until about 2 weeks prior to earnings, although earnings beat for last two qtrs didn't mean a thing except down.  All I hear is the 10 year treasury yield, goes up tech goes down, goes down tech goes up.  Long term holder and bullish for long term.Thoughts anyone?
2021-06-28:Remember: AAPL needs to close above 135 resistance in other to move forward.
2021-06-28:STOP SELLING AT 135, when we break through 135 CLEANLY we hit 137 FAST
2021-06-28:Strong resistance at $135. If it breaks that resistance, $137 comes quickly
2021-06-28:The road to $138 is here folks. Lets continue to buy in preparations for earnings which should give us a nice little pad towards $ 140-145

2021-06-27:what a lot of people don't understand mostly younger people is apple is basically everything in one for a great price. its a hardware company, a software company, a streaming platform, a place were you can run and create a business with the App Store, a cloud company, and recently a healthcare company. this is why i've done nothing buy keep on buying shares and loading u on LEAPs

2021-06-27:watch for another leg up.  no technical damage  yet
2021-06-26:Search - yellen calls for raising debt ceiling warns of catastrophic business insider -Read this the true state of United States finances.Same as maxed maxed maxed out on credit cards with not enough new money to handle the minimum payments so they need to raise their credit card limit and take on and max out more debt to pay old debt and then they will raise it at last minute and go on and max out more more more with no ability to pay minimum in future unless they max out more.And yet with this scenario the strategy of the dems is to spend more and more and more and Bernie and AOC want to spend $6 trillion. AOC says we can just print more money. And spend more.What a debacle of mismanagement. When the straw finally breaks the camels back and no one wil buy our getting junky debt unless it pays way higher rates the USA will pay exhorbitantly to just finance old debt.The dollar will become toilet paper and massive inflation then happens.This is the dems plan to manage our finances.Max out more borrow more to pay old debt because they do not have enough money to make minimum payments and then repeat all the time calling to spend more and more.It’s sick.Very sad and the free everything crowd goes yeah yippee.And the dems say everything is going great they are doing a good job.It’s not the truth.It’s financial mismanagement at its worse.Their handling of the border crisis is absolutely pathetic. We all know that.Biden does not tell Russia don’t hack or else just gives Putin a list of 16 areas not to hack but I guess hack away at the other areas.Biden decides to completely pull out of Afghanistan. Warned it will fall apart. Taliban has already taken over a huge numbers of zones.Biden administration has admitted they are surprised at how much because they thought they would open dialog with the afghan government and that has not happened.Yeah sure.Pathetic.
2021-06-26:AAPL wants to break through that $2.4T glass ceiling so badly, that’s been holding it under for almost a year. Everyone knows this unchartered cap is the only reason AAPL has been dancing on the ceiling. But this will be AAPL’s Summer
2021-06-26:Let Microsoft open its windows 11 “free”app store (free to the app companies not the consumer) with third party unsecured billing and let the hacking begin…..Microsoft customers will get wrecked…..what a transparent political and ill advised move by msft

2021-06-26:Let's put this "scare" if Warren did sell.Last quarter it was reported Berkshire sold a block of stock. After his dividend reinvestment, Berkshire owned more stock then before that sale.Berkshire may be trying to keep the number of shares below a certain percentage of total AAPL outstanding shares to avoid unnecessary paperwork with the SEC
2021-06-26:If price breaks high 29 April 136.47 it will probably go up very fast
2021-06-26:Oops.Down AGAIN.
2021-06-26:Look at the historical prices. The move the past three weeks has been a weekly run of $3+ then $4, and this week $5 from intra week's low and high.This has translated into allowing "everyone to wet their beak." Some with water while others with wine.
2021-06-26:Apple is the alpha dog and will constantly be challenged for the dominant position.the challengers forget apple is more like a thousand pound wolverine waiting it’s time to show its teeth
2021-06-26:Next week will be heavy lifting but it is quarter end and $136+ is very possible. What do I  know?An " understanding" is an "understanding.Have a great weekend
2021-06-26:Past three weeks AAPL has had $3 moves each week; $127, $130, $133.It was posted this week, $136+.Last week AAPL hit $134+ three times as an intra day high. Maybe this week the algorithim players will allow it to run?

2021-06-25:Being a long only I must say I loved the final EOD close at 8:00PM EST. W/that close AAPL saved us a ton of value. Calls must be devasted.

2021-06-25:Do your own diligence this weekend.....look at the close of NLST today,maybe a settlement with the giant Google on patent infringment
2021-06-25:Apple has not performed well this year, my theory is that the overhang on the stock is from the uncertainty surrounding the EPIC lawsuit, investors are wary of anything that affects Apple App Store, negative ruling from judge could be bad news. Any thoughts ?
2021-06-25:What is wrong with this Stock? I wish I sold it and bought PayPal
2021-06-25:1 month  chart  up 6+ nothing to complain  about
2021-06-25:What you'll be doing when you find out Buffett sold off another huge block this quarter.  Remember...keeping Dairy Queen and a railroad and unloading all apple is not a good sign
2021-06-25:Have a good weekend Longs!  We are on our way to a wonderful uprising from now to end of year.  A 0.10 percent drop is nothing to be upset about
2021-06-25:Since Wednesday I have been selling my apple stocks. Bougth them at the beginning of the year, its just pathtic to be 6 month in and 0.29% performant.
2021-06-25:Get in next week cheaper
2021-06-25:Very weak stock..shorts have taken over..let it fall

We have a long way to go, but we're seeing light at the end of the tunnel and trending back to the growth, we expected prior to COVID.

We expect this segment to gain more traction as Zimmer Biomet Dental progresses to launch with a now-trained personnel"

2021-06-25:Consider doing this with your apple certificates...
2021-06-25:Very little action today in the Apple buy/sell world.
2021-06-25:i'm going to stick by my 130 pin today for option expirations.  but something is clearly wrong if the largest company in the market is read when the rest of the market continues to rally.  if this happens again on Monday I'm out.  I'm sure most of you will happily wave goodbye, which is fine.  I'm just a frustrated long hoping for a continued run up with the rest of the market.  Shame on me for thinking this was a good trade.  AAPL is a solid investment, but a TERRIBLE trading opportunity
2021-06-25:Green by the close. Oorah!
2021-06-25:You message board terrorists have really ruined the message boards. Thanks a lot. Go Apple!

2021-06-25:You know apple is buying up shares.So why doesn't apple wait to the last 5 minutes of trading on Fridays and put in a large buy order.?
2021-06-25:BB profit taking today, look out $AAPL !!!!!!!!!!!ACRX climbing, ACRX chart looking very bullish, ACRX reporting a dozen milestones later this year, could see ACRX run 9x by Dec! Do you Due Diligence on ACRX!
2021-06-25:Looks like apple will have to prove that their earnings will get the stock going. The last two earnings reports did not impress the big investors and this is looking like a show me the growth because markets continue setting records and apple barely budges...
2021-06-25:Incredibly disappointing to see virtually every stock on my list green and apple barely able to squeeze out  5 cents.
2021-06-25:Way too many people on here making claims about where the price will be today, tomorrow or the next day. I hope no one here takes any of them seriously.

2021-06-25:Options decay update.   My 140 strikes were bought on Tuesday when the stock was at 133.30.  Here were are on Friday, same stock price and my options are worth 30% less.  I get theta, but that just seems a bit excessive.  I’m only my 3rd day into a 30 day expiration am have lost 30% value.  IV was low so I didn’t think it would crush this much.  Boy was I wrong.  It will take. A big move to the upside for me to break even

2021-06-25:Question for the board.  I have a bunch of 140 strikes expiring on July 23rd.  Should I hold and hope, watching them bleed premium every day, or should I ditch this turd and move on?    Serious question.
2021-06-25:Another red day. I was going to retire but I have to go back to work. Thank you, APPLE
2021-06-25:Typical PElosi tacticsMedia says infrastructure done deal BUT it’s not going to happen without Trillions in social infrastructure and massive hike in tax rates.

2021-06-25:2.22 Trillion dollar company, pays .66% dividend, things that make you go hummmm!  Timmie said he wants apple to be cash neutral.  How do you get to cash neutral with a .66% dividend?
2021-06-25:The nasdaq has never rallied this far off a bear low, without at least 17% correction, since the beginning of nasdaq in 1971.
2021-06-25:What is "painting the tape"?Quarter ending funds run stocks in their portfolio's.
2021-06-25:I was thinking. I do that often.MSFT has a forward P/e of 30.62 and AAPL one of 25.06.Yet, all we here is about AAPL's P/E being rich while MSFT is CNBC's darling.
2021-06-25:Apple is doing just fine.  They always make great money and have excellent procucts.  We have been flat for the past 9 months or so because the stock price had a huge run up and it needs to consolidate before moving up again.  Also recently Apple has had a lot of negative press being included in the government's effort to break up BIG TECH.
2021-06-25:Next week?$136+Words here are not written in sand but etched in stone
2021-06-25:It's better to own swks  and qrvo over Apple..they move up and stay up
2021-06-25:Many people here have the patience of a toddler….and that is the biggest no no for stock investing.

2021-06-25:NASDAQ  70 points UP = Apple. 20 cents UP 😀
2021-06-25:So Microsoft in it's wisdom is telling Apple to open it's system up to viruses, malware, and other intrusive software.  This would be better to Apple how?  Apple should just give Microsoft the 2 finger salute and stick with the closed system.  I have a Mac I bought in 2005 and a Mac Book Air that is 10 years old.  Both work perfectly with no issues ever.  Since 2005 I have had to purchase 4 Microsoft based PC's to run tax software.  Which is the better system?
2021-06-25:The stock price has clearly stagnated. Just like Apple's products.
2021-06-25:Flat everyday, week and month. Boring and non-profitable consider selling now..

2021-06-24:$WIMI $AAPL $AMZN Looking for a re-entry during the next NASDAQ correction.
2021-06-24:DeSpirito's research shows that quality stocks have underperformed since COVID-19 vaccine announcements came to fore back in November 2020, sending their valuations lower. Instead of paying up to own quality companies amidst a global economic recovery (ones that could lift their dividends and share repurchase plans because of the macro rebound), investors have largely avoided or sold these stocks in favor of riskier bets that produced strong gains early in the recovery.Now, DeSpirito said the tide is about to swing back to quality. "We see potential for quality to rerate higher. As the cycle evolves, the market will look ahead to more normalized growth rates, and investors are likely to grow more cautious amid concerns around taxes, inflation and the timing of a Fed policy shift," DeSpirito explained.
2021-06-24:Nasdaq is on best streak in history without 20% correction. Nasdaq up 118% off the lows. Man that fed can print! But maybe 123% is the top !!!!

2021-06-24:Lawyers at McDermott Will & Emery on Friday removed a breach-of-contract lawsuit against Apple to Pennsylvania Eastern District Court. The suit, filed by Ace Law and William W. Uchimoto Law on behalf of APT Systems and Snapt Games, contends that Apple stood by after a third party took control of Snapt's 'ThemeZone Live Wallpapers' gaming app and changed the bank account. The case is 2:21-cv-02121, APT Systems, Inc. et al v. Apple IncI’m long both companies AAPL and APTY!   Although with #spera I see a lot more upside potential for APTY in the short term
2021-06-24:$135 crucial price ( resistance ) level. Need to punch through it......then $150 EASY!!
2021-06-24:Lets do the Apple Shuffle.  One step forward & two steps back...!
2021-06-24:Apple will head back to 120-122 bottom  rates are moving higher  and tech will get crushed
2021-06-24:Tomorrow red or green Apple?
2021-06-24:Is it me or, is this board way worse than it was even just 6 months ago?
2021-06-24:microsoft just gave apple a gift!....microsoft will allow third party billing apps on its new windows 11 app store.....this will compromise security,spread malware and allow access to your accounts when you open the billing app.......a nightmare in the making.......tim cook is correct,security is paramount.......by trying to stick it to apple microsoft polluted windows 11 and made apples app store the superior product!
2021-06-24:I think I’ll launch a fee-free App Store too…on my useless freakin operating system…good luck with that, Microsheet
2021-06-24:Why is AAPL underperforming the market and ALL 3 indexes this year????
2021-06-24:Up $3.00 this week. You bashers have serious issues.
2021-06-24:Plummet continues AH on record day...this stock is complete and utter rubbish
2021-06-24:134 is approaching resistance , I suggest Apple with drop to a max of 124 before it breaks the line a sit has created a triangle trading range over the past very disappointing 9 months. It will be going up and longe term indicators show it isn the over sold range. For all those lone hang in there and don't get frustrated. I hope I am wring and it goes through resistance but the market rarely goes straight up.....
2021-06-24:microsoft has chosen to allow third party billing apps on its windows 11 app store.they have abandoned your security to stick it to apple.....this will be a great marketing tool for appl app store.in addition ,no apple antitrust because the consumer has another app choice....non secure microsoft app store
2021-06-24:Sooner or later it’d be apple’s turn to fly high
2021-06-24:why did aapl have such a bad day when the market was up so high?
2021-06-24:Ask your self why did apple tank on such a good day
2021-06-24:Apple will rise tomorrow over 135 , today my opinion it was basing
2021-06-24:$125-127 right after earnings released! $AAPL is such a disappointment for traders.
2021-06-24:Bad day for apple
2021-06-24:Here comes da plunge.
2021-06-24:No worries. The bottom will drop at the 10 minute mark.
2021-06-24:Guarantee I sell in the money Calls and this thing will takeoff!
2021-06-24:We have a long way until earnings.  Young longs need to relax and sit back.  If your holding Apple 🍏 for at least 5 years you don’t need to worry about this noise
2021-06-24:When it was $126 you all said wait until it’s $130.  Now your crying like little beeches
2021-06-24:Stock can’t hold gains and always loses more into close. 11 straight months.
2021-06-24:Where is the “close green” guy? Moronic.
2021-06-24:I have always been  long-term with Apple so whatever happens each day, it is what it is.￼
2021-06-24:Major correction for apple   120 -122
2021-06-24:Selling half of my position
2021-06-24:Watch it really spike lower at the 30 minute mark.
2021-06-24:Who thinks Cook will give guidance this earnings?
2021-06-24:Why is AAPL underperforming all 3 major indexes this year?
2021-06-24:Told you. Lower lows into close. Utter trash.
2021-06-24:We will close $135 tomorrow. Have some patience. This is a moderate pullback before it can breakout its $135 ish resistance level.
2021-06-24:L
2021-06-24:Haha apple couldn’t hold major correction 120 buy in
2021-06-24:Trillion two and scammer of them All
2021-06-24:It will be lucky to hold $133 by close.
2021-06-24:Trend is slipping down .no one is buying the hype
2021-06-24:A pretty strong 3-day rally for a stock that had been in the mud. No shock to me it ran out of some steam. Short term traders cashing out etc. I made a few $$ buying the 135 puts this morning and closed them out. As an option trader at $133.40 I have limited interest here. Could go either way tomorrow. After a strong rally in the overall market...if you put a gun to my head I'd buy more PUTS. The amount of calls sold is staggering so as per usual the sellers of the calls will likely be the winners. Still holding a core postion LONG for the long haul. GLTA.
2021-06-24:Patience..don't buy apple..it's peaked and has a rough time staying here .
2021-06-24:Can’t move at all over 134.5.. came here after 3 months and now returning back to 119 again. Tired
2021-06-24:I have no words anymore YTD didn't move at all
2021-06-24:Told you. Lower and lower into close.
2021-06-24:Low of the day close. Mark it.
2021-06-24:The next 6 to 12 month are going to be fantastic!
2021-06-24:Back to back blowout quarters and this stock can't move...........pathetic
2021-06-24:Has all the markings of low of the day finish. Woof.
2021-06-24:BIG BOYS KEEP AAPL DOWN TO LOAD CALL OPTIONS - CAN YOU TELL???
2021-06-24:Buyers be carful this is a major bear trap same rotation again  will trade at 120 or below
2021-06-24:This call can make my $10K from here to JULY - I bought 20 Calls a minute ago.AAPL Dec 17 2021 135 Call
2021-06-24:microsoft going after apple for antitrust is the fox guarding the hen house.apple os is gaining on windows especially with apples m1 and m2 chips only in apple products....microsoft will get burned with this preemptive strike.tech should not turn on each other or they will all go down.
2021-06-24:The IBD's buy point is $137 and bits....whatever that means!
2021-06-24:I bet we close green.
2021-06-24:I see AAPL eCar on the horizon. Hold your AAPL positions.
2021-06-24:The ones here telling you “no worries for me”…own all of 10 shares. Disgraceful performance.

2021-06-24:SELL SELL SELL before the bubble bursts.  APPLE to $110 SICK FREAKS.  The rest of the market will tank with it.........................Back to the 1970's stock market..................SELL SELL SELL
2021-06-24:Looks like 135 is not possible
2021-06-24:Banks have no idea what to do with their abundance of cash unless the fed says ok to buyback. Well how about why they give .0001 interest on savings accounts. Scam
2021-06-24:come on...come on do i see green?
2021-06-24:So now it goes against the Nasdaq ? What is going on
2021-06-24:...Trying to picture the kind of person who needs to trash someone or something 24/7...I can't though...It's not in my nature. Long AAPL.
2021-06-24:Holy #$%$ down on another record day...that is absolutely hilarious
2021-06-24:WISH has 3x more volume than $TSLA and 2x the volume of $F and $AAPL the top volume tickers. We are like $GME just before it rocketed on huge volume and big short squeeze
2021-06-24:Red or green at end of day today???
2021-06-24:Look at a 1 month chart. That tells you everything you need to know why it’s down slightly on an up market day. It’s the funny thing traders do called profit taking
2021-06-24:Imagine 20-100 billion diverted from big tech into other companies. Huge economic boost vs more buyback of mega blob.
2021-06-24:Apple action 4 out of 5 days a week
2021-06-24:It?s only 1:30 ya cry #$%$
2021-06-24:Just shows you they can drop it like a rock whenever they want. Gains? Penny at a time. Not good.
2021-06-24:C’mon Apple!! 😖
2021-06-24:Apple price action has become very predictive. Here is what I have been doing If you own Apple, every Monday check out which strike price has the most open interest and sell $1 higher strike call option. Market makers are making sure this stock doesn’t reach the most open interest levels. Get paid while waiting.
2021-06-24:134 calls are the target for today, once its done they might close it right at 135 tomorrow!
2021-06-24:The sellers here are the swing traders that got in at $122 or so a couple of weeks ago. This is totally normal price action. It may dip again tomorrow. It’s gonna rise into earnings. Just like every time. Will it sell off AFTER earnings is the question
2021-06-24:have patience and relax. Ive owned AAPL for many years.  i'm nearing retirement and recently consolidated most of my holdings into this one stock. I know from the trend over the years that it will pay off very soon.
2021-06-24:cashing in some water. The dissent has started.￼
2021-06-24:Apple is a major bear trap  stay away
2021-06-24:Your a bunch of stupid lazy day traders that don?t know #$%$  The rest relax
2021-06-24:Apple is showing it's not as good as it's suppliers in stock buyers
2021-06-24:You better hope the Nasdaq and dow hold these levels today. If not, look out below.
2021-06-24:Considering the market and all other considerations…this should be up a minimum of $1.50. What is it? It’s red.
2021-06-24:￼ unbelievable…
2021-06-24:time to buy puts
2021-06-24:$133.33 extremely critical in the next 2 months.Next mid-term critical levels:$166.66or$100.00.

2021-06-24:And she goes red. Good lord what a #$%$
2021-06-24:Looks to me like the days are over of this stock seeing $3 to $5 daily gains during bull market sessions. You’re getting pennies now…and sometimes red.
2021-06-24:New pairs trading strategy.  Short APPL and go long S&P (or any other big cap stock).  Guaranteed to make money since this thing constantly underperforms
2021-06-24:Even a hint of a giveback today in Dow and Nasdaq and Apple will be down $1.
2021-06-24:Stocks are all moving .. Apple down today?
2021-06-24:I’m jealous of my friend who bought Tesla….  He’s laughing at his friend who stuck with Apple.
2021-06-24:The wall is all the weak hands on this board complaining. Want it to go up? Buy more shares and put your money where your mouth is. Supply and demand. Be patient
2021-06-24:Fire Cook. Non innovator
2021-06-24:My decision to invest in AAPL stock starting in 2009 has been the one of the most rewarding choices in my life. Life changing for the better. I'm sure during the next decade, I'll continue to reap the benefits of being an AAPL investor. Great company.
2021-06-24:Like I said , going red. Absolute garbage.
2021-06-24:What happened to $134.64 Take this garbage out of FAANG
2021-06-24:100 record setting Naz days and you're stuck at last years split price...can't make this stuff up
2021-06-24:AAPL stopped going up.The reason:Longs here started adding to their losing positions.Market makers don't have to prop up the price higher to lure them in anymore.The horrific reversal is coming soon.
2021-06-24:Number 1 used product and I phone but the stock doesn’t move. It bubbles every 2 months I love it
2021-06-24:I told you folks about LWLG on June 16 when it was $5.80...It's $9.50 today...I hope some of you paid attention...
2021-06-24:Another record setting Naz day and you'll prolly go negative...
2021-06-24:Still going absolutely nowhere...Naz could go to 20K and you're stuck like a stick in the mud
2021-06-24:lowest trading range ever for apple,  since the split. no volume.  no one is buying here.
2021-06-24:Microsoft,  Facebook all time highs today
2021-06-24:SELL and LOCK in the Capital Gains in this Massive Stock BUBBLE! The Valuations are ABSURD!AVOID THE US STOCKS!$AAPL $JPM $TSLA
2021-06-24:People on this board don’t like to hear the truth - Apple is dead money, 2T MC. The so called iPhone super cycle is all fake! People are barely upgrading. Barely pays a dividend. Buy backs? No share movement other than south.
2021-06-24:Long AAPLBrandeis University : You can no longer say"Trigger warning""victim""survivor""walk in"  (cuz some people can't walk""freshman""policeman""congressman""you're killing it""can i give you a hand?""the rule of thumb""picnic""no can do""long time no see" (cuz some people can't see)...Long AAPL
2021-06-24:the only thing I own is Apple stock my daughter and I both agree it's well worth it
2021-06-24:Hopefully the guy with the ponytail on his chin is on half time report to pump this turd.
2021-06-24:my daughter is a firm believer in Apple products she has computers phone earbuds and watches
2021-06-24:Such a strong market and this turd is barely up - what gives ?
2021-06-24:Why would Apple open a store in LA ?Next time they loot Apple’s store will be the first one they attack.
2021-06-24:Why is aapl so sluggish. It has been struggling to go higher for the last 3, 4, 5 months. Why??????????
2021-06-24:Ah, reliable old AAPL.  underperforming the market as usual.  I’m bullish, but I’m so tired of this snail getting kicked while turds like TSLA scream higher.  Very frustrating being an AAPL holder of call options.  It’s just a slow bleed of premium every damn day
2021-06-24:Option sellers working it down. $133.50 may be the magic number.
2021-06-24:How low can it go
2021-06-24:This stock is so annoying
2021-06-24:SELL SELL SELL  This market is a bubble ready to burst.........Dont be a stupid SICK FREAK.....APPLE to $110
2021-06-24:I am in cash with APPL now.  Waiting for clues to buy. In the mean time I just added BAP (credit corp) and DLTR that look cheap despite solid Q1 earnings. TSLA also are in my portfolio and will break 750 next week. BAP for sure 150 is back. Bank of South America is solid Q1 earnings.
2021-06-24:someone or something is keep the 135 calls  out of the money. gees
2021-06-24:Going red. What else is new?
2021-06-24:Already caught in the maw of opex. Another big up day for market wasted.
2021-06-24:Rocket Companies has +142 EPS... Apple has 4$ EPS. That's like 30x...
2021-06-24:Who else has calls for $140 by 8/20
2021-06-24:BIG MONEY
2021-06-24:Big wall of resistance at $135.
2021-06-24:APPLE is the safest play in my portfolio. I have 312 shares at $309, I'll hold until the next split in 4 years. Then I will buy 100 more, easy money.
2021-06-24:Red today with the market going higher. This stock drives me nuts

2021-06-24:Breakout begins
2021-06-24:Imagine being that stupid shorting apple and then coming here thinking you actually have an impact on other people with some stupid comments, jesus.
2021-06-24:Good Morning APPLE longs ! $137 is our next hurdle. Establishing resistance there will create a great platform prior to the typical earnings for JULY ! Keep buying and adding, lets keep it going 136 Next week
2021-06-24:The Snow Clown reiterates $140 by Civic Holiday.
2021-06-24:$138 incoming!
2021-06-24:APPL will hit $137.50 and may move higher. Looking for $140 a share soon. All expectations are indicating stronger than expected earning report and better business prospects. Watch out for APPLE.
2021-06-24:Just a hint, have owned for years, it is DEAD MONEY.  You would get a better return with Treasuries
2021-06-24:Last week, AAPL ran to $132.50 then settled at $130+ on Friday.AAPL may run $135+ but no guarantees about Frida's close.
2021-06-24:We gonna fly today baby
2021-06-24:Who sold earlier this month $123-$126?  Haaaa

2021-06-24:Shall we see 136 today?
2021-06-24:This will climb.  There’s room to move up here.
2021-06-24:When you get where where you want to be; what next?Last time WE delivered.Earnings are weeks away; Think about it.
2021-06-24:If you had invested $1,000 in AAPL ten years ago, it is now worth $11,000.If you invested $1,000 in 1008 when we firat came here in 2008; it is now worth $17,000+.Everyone was invited from the RIMM board back then,
2021-06-24:IF you sold weekly puts, close them out.They are already down 90% from Monday's dip.
2021-06-24:WEeks ago we posted "Let's come to an understanding"."Why not $3 baby steps per week  until the week of earnings: $127, $130, $133, $136, etcThis way no one gets hurt; etc Here, as in chess, once a move is on the board; it remains.
2021-06-24:Yahoo would not allow be post yesterday.Looking at the one day graph yesterday I saw $1 see-saws between almost the same intra day high as low.Today may be the same.$136+ next week is the target.
2021-06-24:135 135 135   maybe today
2021-06-24:Haha Anti-Trust cases …. Remember how much richer Rockefeller got after they broke Standard to 30 something companies just by being a shareholder! Those cases are no fear for us because no company these days is at the level of Standard back then. Apple is pure value no matter when you start buying , as long as you keep buying from time to time to average cost.

2021-06-23:And is everything a scam.Search this.Investigation finds subway tuna sandwiches contain no tuna.This was claimed before so they did a real investigation and they could not even find a trace of tuna.Not even a molecule of tuna.Nothing.
2021-06-23:Search - Janet yelled warns of catastrophic default business insider - And read all about it.I am sure they will work out an extension but is this the state we really want our countries finances in.What happens some year in the future if the rest of the world just shuns buying USA debt/bonds.Won’t be pretty.The country really better get it together before the dollar becomes toilet paper someday.
2021-06-23:Search and read about this.On business insider.Janet yelled wants a needed extension to pay back federal debt due in July.She warns of a catastrophic default if no extension.And with this the condition of the debt the dems want to spend more and more and more and more.And crazy Bernie says the spending package should be $6 trillion.Is that crazy or what.
2021-06-23:The house members are already fighting with each other to earn the favor of big tech.neither side wants to be on the wrong side of the trade.

2021-06-23:I was thinkin today that maybe Yahoo had the guts to decide to permanently shut down these boards.
2021-06-23:Another happy trading day for me...$$$$$
2021-06-23:If AAPL can open $133.99 tomorrow, that would signal upside!
2021-06-23:It was a good day for rest and consolidation in order to get higher.
2021-06-23:People who missed $120 will say AAPL will go to $110 so that can buy @ $110.

2021-06-23:in regards to antitrust......politicians will not bite the hand that feeds them.....maybe a little scratch,just for show,but not a bite.appl,goog,amzn (wapo),msft and fb are very influential especially when it comes to reelections.
2021-06-23:will Tim Cooke's conversation with Nancy Pelosi be disclosed in the next quarterly report?
2021-06-23:I believe we see $137 by next. Any one long on this position will benefit as earnings spike wont come for another two weeks
2021-06-23:Just short term maintenance. No fear.I think $130-131 is the minor drop.Technically, $126-127 is the bottom in short term.Then AAPL will reach $137 with solid support and go rally directly to $147.Don't take profit, if you are rich.I am waiting to buy more around $126.
2021-06-23:silence is golden! No TD101 no awesome. Only the birds and bees and the wind in the apple trees…
2021-06-23:Apple is not the right stock to trade. Apple 🍏 is one to buy and hold!
2021-06-23:$WIMI I’m in LONG Term!!  This one will be worth it! $BABA $AAPL $SQ
2021-06-23:If the AAPL rally persists this time, unlike the prior ones in the last 10 months, then AAPL is most definitely a manipulated stock, and this last triple witching was the calculated milestone we simply had to pass. The whole thing is sickening—10 months (and 3 ERs) of shareholders’ lives wasted due to the degenerate options gambling market
2021-06-23:Trying to figure this all out. One day I read a compelling article proving that AAPL investors should be getting ready for winter and two days later there are two more articles saying AAPL is getting ready to go through the roof. I sold off a few shares two days ago, maybe I should buy them back!
2021-06-22:Love Apple for the long !! Great company and I believe it's up $46 the last 12 months.
2021-06-22:Does anyone know how to turnoff IRRITATING editor picks from iOS Map?

2021-06-22:138 by friday
2021-06-22:Looking at the graph on Apple if they can get above 133.00 the trading range will change on this stock with the next resistance at 138.00.  It does seem that while the fundamentals of this stock have improved the technical's have yet to catch up.  Wedbush has as an example 185.00 price target on Apple and eventually stock price will catch fire.  Good luck to investors.

2021-06-21:Yahoo is like a communist version of The National Enquirer, now. But, if one is into victim hood, reverse discrimination and cultural Marxism I guess it's a cool place to be. I'm surprised that Yahoo still has a "Finance" section since capitalism is so evil.

2021-06-21:Anyone that has sold AAPL in the last 20 years to buy anything else hasn't proven much if anything. Remember Warren Buffett didn't buy AAPL until 5-6 years ago. During the time they had several splits and went from 6-8 dollars to 700??? I have to question anyone dumping aapl? Just trying to use their influence to move the price, probably to buy more.
2021-06-21:Toni S at it again, he is going to be wrong again, Apple is a buy here.
2021-06-21:Have a nice day
2021-06-21:$133+ Friday close?Look at last week, The previous week WE posted $130 would print. AAPL ran to $132.50 then settled at $130+ due to triple option expiration.Anyone who shorted AAPL at $131+ got lucky. WE never suggest shorting any stock  at anytimeMy point?

2021-06-20:To all the people nervous about bonds, interest rates and the fearmongers spreading fear, I have to respond the way a true long would. I have two words for you folks: Diamond Hands. Learn it, live it, and love it. Of course, if you're a trader then you don't know what I'm talking about...so go Google it and get educated.If you're nervous about interest rates then maybe equities aren't for you. Highly doubtful you'll find a better company with more profitability and more free cash flow. Do your own due diligence. Maybe you  should sell your shares and invest in gold or something tangible like metals if you're so uncertain. We hear the same story about bonds and interest rates each year. The same story about the national debt...and the household debt. The same story of the rate of bankruptcies, of how mom and pop stores are dwindling, etc etc etc etc etc. It's deja vu each year.Is this something new? Of course not. Do you realize this is all short term "noise". Could equities tank in the short term? Maybe. Maybe not. If you're really in it for the long term, like I am, then you really don't care. Buy the dips and take advantage. This "noise"  is just another small blimp on the radar for longs. Cash is trash right now. Stay invested. Stay focused. Holding long and strong and never selling. Apple to the moon....and beyond, kiddies!
2021-06-20:We are going higher from here and don’t care if they will raise interest rates from 0 in a company that prints money.
2021-06-20:the fear these spammers are trying to spread over a dollar and change fall on triple witching day is embarrassing to read. so desperate.
2021-06-20:If you have a few bucks kicking around let's buy up the remaining float of AMC and put those god awful hedgy shorts oyt of business.   They have been a thorn in all our #$%$ for way too long.  Pick up 100 shares and hold it.  You will make money.
2021-06-20:I’ll tell you all one thing.I’m now using every spare cent to pay off my mortgage.Im selling all my stocks except one apple account with a low average and a great dividend payer.The party is over i think and a bear market to correct back to normal valuations is occurring now.apple normal with a supercycle will be 15-20 P/e
2021-06-19:Everybody seems spooked about inflation. The bond market isn’t spooked at all. The 10 year yield actually went lower last week. Call me crazy but I think we’ve just witnessed the inflation top. And besides, Powell said 2 rate hikes in 2023. So it will be at 1/2%. That’s still incredibly low.
2021-06-19:$76 is a done deal.Unless AAPL hits $76, longs here won't wake up.
2021-06-19:The colossal fraud in the final phase to suck up more money from the innocent.Sell before she starts going down. For real, this time.

2021-06-19:"Do not hang everything on one nail"Most basic law of investing...Diversification
2021-06-19:for all you buy and hold people,  here is a different look, i trade apple usually 1000 to 1500 shares on average, this year alone i have made 36.50 points total, now that is trading it in and out to accumulate it, so trading  works if you cna do it, i concentrate on a few stocks only,  The game is make points, do you really think big players buy and hold, NO, they trade the game, you make more trading it then holding forever,
2021-06-19:You don’t need to understand charts, options, etc., to know that investing in Apple now will make you a truckload of money in the future.  This is a no-brainer.
2021-06-19:Forecasting higher in future
2021-06-19:Last Friday, AAPL closed at $127.35This Friday $130.45.$3+THere is your magical "3' again.Interesting!

2021-06-18:It's painful watching my money sit in Apple while Nvidia, covid vaccine stocks and God dang AMC sees ridiculous gains. I was under the impression apple was the bee's knees for investing. remember the run right before the split? I bought the day after the split thinking the prices would attract new investors and the run would continue. but, it didn't. it just flopped, crashed, stalled, pooped out. I've now been in apple for over a year and have not seen any appreciation of my investment. what gives? why would I invest money if it just sits there like a bank account? I don't think I'm being impatient, a year is a long time. I'd like even 3percent. Even that would be enough.

Manufacture and fabricate and distort every fear and imagined crisis in the minds of their extremest, isolationist, xenophobic worst nightmarish scenario, unleash it in all forms of social media ( including forums like this one from the usual subjects that bow to the dog whistle.)and right wing news channels and blogs. So if you happen to notice comments here that are incredibly cynical and pessimistic about America's ability to successfully overcome, thrive, and prosper economically, financially, and most importantly,  psychologically, from the one of the most devastating events of our lifetime– you will know them for what they spew out with their comments.  Here' to America coming back, The economy coming back. The world coming back. God Bless America!

2021-06-17:LG Electronics threw in the towel on manufacturing smartphones earlier this year. Now, according to a new report, it’s considering stocking Apple products in its 400 LG Best Shops stores in South Korea.The companies supposedly are negotiating for an Apple store-within-a-store setup that will sell iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. This sounds similar to when Apple set up mini-stores inside CompUSA outlets around the United States in the late 1990s. As with the CompUSA mini-stores, the new LG outlets might be staffed by Apple employees.
2021-06-17:Looks like a breakout up to $150.  Earnings will really seal the deal
2021-06-17:Market s will sell off tomorrow
2021-06-17:GOOGL better

2021-06-17:I saw somebody mentioning they wanted a stock split. Wth are you thinking. Our float is too large as it is. In addition this stock moves slower than my dead grandmother.
2021-06-17:150 is next…
2021-06-17:The real rose will be in July. Buy in before then. Going up !

2021-06-17:I’m so happy to see APPL finally rising !
2021-06-17:At this point, I'm just exasperated with Apple stock.  This thing has gone NOWHERE since last August!   Even though I do own alot of Apple shares (5007 shares), I can't really do much with them at the moment because the shares are "trapped" in a trust fund until the passing of the person who originally gave me the trust fund.  I guess I'll just be like those 3 monkeys where I see no Apple, hear no Apple & talk no Apple for now.
2021-06-17:love my apple race ponies
2021-06-17:Imagine using apple products in current year... lame and outdated
2021-06-17:Money rotating out of Financials into tech. Apple will catch up with NVDA in 2nd half. NVDA +200 in 1 month!!!

2021-06-17:Market must be getting ready for the parabolic faze like AMC! If home prices and rent keep going parabolic, I’ll be living in a cardboard box on the beach living the American dream.
2021-06-17:Shorted at $132Tia
2021-06-17:Just a simple thought option expiration is tomorrow for the monthly, triple witching as they call it. It likes round numbers I’m willing to guess the round number is $135.00. It is it $130?Contemplating that for all
2021-06-17:The consensus buy for Apple is right around $137. At that level a clear breakout is happening. Professional investors and traders wait for a breakout before jumping in. This isn’t a breakout yet. If we get to $137, I see this popping over $145 going into earnings in late July. The trend is your friend
2021-06-17:It’s amazing when you print 10 trillion and hand out checks for nothing. The fed is thinking about thinking about printing more $$$$$$$$$$
2021-06-17:Dumped my 500 shares I bought for a trade a few days ago for a $4.00 profit per share...Holding onto my long term position of 800 shares of AAPL ...of course.
2021-06-17:At this rate AAPL will be in the pink sheets before Christmas.
2021-06-17:Almost positive for the year.
2021-06-17:AAPL underperforming the market yet again.What a #$%$
2021-06-17:It’s funny how the stupid bubble posts disappear on days like these???  Clowns
2021-06-17:Look out below! This will finish red today or up just $.10. Watch what happens with 20 minutes left. It will be terrible. Market manipulation to the highest level.
2021-06-17:I am selling at 600.00
2021-06-17:Way overbought...don’t get caught holding the bag for these pumpers ...charts don’t lie, this pig is way overdue for huge pullback
2021-06-17:Come on beast
2021-06-17:Folks were given 2k per person during the first quarter and told to stay at home. That boosted apple earnings. That is insane. Where is the big dollars coming from in q2 q3 when millions unemployed and some facing evictions at the end of moratorium?
2021-06-17:At some point that monster quarter has to be accounted for
2021-06-17:Tech is back which smart people knew would happen.

2021-06-17:that fast dip just showed you who the bums are on this board. all the Donny cucks hoping the market crashes, mute them all.
2021-06-17:As I’ve posted before: Everyone always throwing out dumb reasons why AAPL hasn’t moved much. Stocks go through lulls all the time. AAPL had a big run up prior to split. It had its biggest quarter ever but it didn’t move. Hedge funds always watch AAPL. If it doesn’t move then they concentrate on spending money elsewhere usually riskier bets and manipulators are keeping the price low shaking out the weak investors. Then at the end of the year the stock starts to make its move usually because the quarters are good and the new products are announced. Everyone wonders why then the price action moves. When Apple starts moving up 3-5 dollars you’ll see more institutions and hedge funds pile in
2021-06-17:Calls puts under 130 above 132, this ends tomorrow that ends next week, #$%$ I make good money by coding and watching stocks, price goes down and I like the company I buy, goes up and I sell, yes if I need to hold a bag like gold or Tesla I hold, my primary income is my job, and no I am not planning on waiting 10 years for stock to go up few thousand, stop telling everyone they need to be long just cause you bought in at 138$

2021-06-17:Feels good seeing this above 125
2021-06-17:Sell a small amount of Apple and invest in SENS.  SENS is company with revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring device. It’s up for FDA approval anytime. Many investors are on the fence thinking FDA approval will be for 3rd or 4th quarter.  The process has already been being reviewed for over 40 business days now. Remember this isn’t a new drug being reviewed by 15 people. This is a already approved product that is under upgrading approval. Way different kind of review my friends. This could take another 60 days or could be tomorrow morning.it’s approval for upgrades to an already approved device. Couple case workers and about 6-10 business weeks and done. Unless they have concerns and we would already know that by being 8 weeks in minus the holiday. I honestly predict right before next earnings report. Then we see 8-10 easy.
2021-06-17:God loves 🍏 we need to be patient, 150+ is not so far 🚀🚀🚀😊

2021-06-17:Told ya haaaaa
2021-06-17:Stay long. I've been in since the price was 3.08  I've seen many corrections, 2 bear market-wide bears, and a few AAPL bears, lots of bad news, lots of good news. So far so good. Sure, anything can happen, and businesses can fail, but I think I can hold my shares a little longer and see more gain. Just the share buybacks alone should make that highly probable.
2021-06-17:"muscling a stock" works for a blink of the eye but AAPL will be AAPL.I think AAPL closes at or near $130 on Friday. IT may rally $131+ or even dip $128 before then.Then next week WE can see $133+.$3+ steps higher per week?
2021-06-17:Anytime fed says anything good or bad the market takes a dump.  Good time to buy,  second have will be stellar

2021-06-17:$111.12.A scary price.
2021-06-17:I think you should sell if you don't want to see AAPL below $126.61 again.
2021-06-17:Apple has been a big part of my portfolio for the last eight years and I’ve done very well with it. I am selling a small piece of Apple holdings to go into SENS Do your DD and check out SENS.  They are waiting on FDA approval for a 180 day glucose monitoring system. This system Will greatly improve diabetics lives. Stock price is expected to mirror what happen with Dexcom another diabetic device company. Price is a bargain if you get it before the FDA approval which is expected by 3 qtr.

2021-06-16:Shorts seem very angry....guess the big guys took all their money .maybe if they went long they would be happy....Some advice,buy apple,walk away for a couple of years ,have some fun and enjoy the steady ride up.apple is not a good day trading stock....the swings are to small.go to crypto and meme stocks if you want to make a quick ,easy fortune.in fact, go to reddit,buy on margin and risk it all
2021-06-16:Thursday or Friday there will be news out that will make the shares pop again.140 is the next stop.
2021-06-16:All it would take to convert the shorts to longs would be to gift them a iPhone 12 max and a iPad pro for the holidays.once they use these products they will understand the value of apple.
2021-06-16:Bought 2 more shares today. Feel ver comfortable with this company. Looking to buy 3 shares every month for the rest of the year.
2021-06-16:It’s the 40th anniversary of the recession that Paul Volcker induced on purpose (w/Reagan’s blessing) also to curb inflation. Back then you could buy AAPL for 10 cents a share—a measly $769k investment would have made you a billionaire today
2021-06-16:2 Trill evaluation and markets at record highs...seems to be only one way this can go
2021-06-16:Hope you're smart enough to realize that one day soon you'll awake to the bottom dropping out on this thing rather than a spike...especially when it sat idle (even lost money) during record market highs.  Any oddsmaker would tell you that
2021-06-16:It’s all fake upward trend due to stocks buyback is what’s going on. $AAPL won’t be able survive long inflation. It will again dive right after earnings.
2021-06-16:Tech companies borrow money to grow the company. Higher rates effect the bottom line. Apple doesn’t have much debt but when tech sells off, it drops also
2021-06-16:The Fed is as crooked as they come, plain and simple fact
2021-06-16:What you people need to realize is the Fed can stop the bull market anytime they want to an Apple will still be worth apple but a lot less
2021-06-16:All this drama with this stock!Way it is going.......2 months from now it will probably be .50 one way or another from today's close.
2021-06-16:All I’m going to say is I told you so Apple will trade back down to 122-125
2021-06-16:I picked up a share today. Think it will go up? I’m really nervous it will go down. What do you professionals think? TIA
2021-06-16:The market might get a little discouraging for a week or so. Hopefully Apple only drops a percent or 3. I’m not really in the mood to ride this down again
2021-06-16:just hold. feds are trapping bears left and right. tomm will be a big red opening. don't get fooled lol by these small traps.
2021-06-16:Apple needs to move into healthcare before the electric vehicle.  Everyone needs some type of healthcare service, not everyone can afford or need an electric vehicle.  There is a lot of competition in the auto industry with small profit margins.  Apple would not have near the competition with its technology in the healthcare area.
2021-06-16:Looks like apple will head back to 122-125 again
2021-06-16:If it can drop back to 127 it's a buy again
2021-06-16:6/16 MF - If Amazon continues to trade at its current price-to-cash-flow multiple of 25, which it has been for 15 yrs, the stock price could reach $5,000 in just the next 2 yrs, putting it well on pace to double by 2026. Normally, analysts' price targets, which are more short-term focused . . .  But ? one analyst from Susquehanna Bancshares, a unit of Truist Financial, has a price target on the stock as high #$%$500, which seems quite reasonable when measured against Amazon's pace of growth, improving profitability, and current valuation.
2021-06-16:Apple stock with its specific characteristics, became the target for powerful speculators.
2021-06-16:Why the after hour drop??
2021-06-16:Did not take long for the players to take down the stock
2021-06-16:Anyone bashing apple or feeling down about it, talk to me by mid july heading into earnings when apple is at 145-150. Apple moves sideways for a bit then has MAJOR run ups. Just how its always been. Mid july $145 EASY!
2021-06-16:Go Apple! What a great stock. Cook is doing a great job.

2021-06-16:Apple has more than 5x’d its price in just the last five years. Frankly I’m glad to see it take a breather so I can load up before the next 5x rocket ship blasts off.
2021-06-16:I don't typically do anything other then scim these boards since it's full of high hopers or desperate bears but I'll put my 2 cents out on something. The iPhone (although not knew) is still absolutely revolutionary. The iPhone is the highest sought phone amongst children, the largest sought among students, and even the largest sought by buisness entities and older individuals. Why? Because it's design was built off of being user friendly for all individuals.Best part is, I haven't even gotten to the best part. As a cyber security and network systems student, I can atest that Apple products are some of (if not the most) secure products in the world. They constantly update for vulnerabilities, all devices are encrypted by default, and their company has never allowed any kind of system backdoors. Nor have they ever caved to any government influence, of any county. That is why the Pentagon, among other federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies chose iPhone.I encourage everyone to make their own choices- but I sure know what mine is 🙂

2021-06-14:Looks like $135 or even higher is a possibility this Friday if the market does not melt!
2021-06-14:Of course you already know what will transpire from that "Big Tech" bill. Absolutely nothing. We've all seen it come up numerous times over the past decade. It's all just fluff. The government knows Big Tech employs thousands and pays billions in taxes. They don't want to kill that source of tax revenue. They're just doing it for the public. History is a great teacher and teaches us never to forget the past.
2021-06-14:Half a liter of prune juice and I’m gonna have to go to bed. Luv JoJo

2021-06-14:Bitcoin and stock trading rights now will be on every wise individual list, in a few months you'll thank yourself for taking such decisions. The world is gradually moving out of the I work for my boss era, people make money from the comfort of their homes these days. The world is going digital, working smart is far better than work hard. Although trading Crypto Currency and stocks isn't an easy task, one needs to have proper guidance and experience. I would count myself lucky to have Rhonda J. Bishop as a guide, with her signals and assistance I have worked up my trading portfolio to 8 btc within the space of 5 weeks, my losses are minimal compared to my previous trades, and am more grounded with the knowledge of trading with each passing trade session. Rhonda can be reached for assistance on Telegram @ Rhonda_Bi Bitcoin isn't slowing down soon, now is the time to make the best of this bullish spread.
2021-06-14:Never 2 up days in a row.Tomorrow it will tank.
2021-06-14:I’m so ready for a nice, long steady run. Apple still down $2.21 (1.67%) YTD even after today’s jump. Now that the hedge funds are dumping shares as the buyback continues, it should climb.
2021-06-14:buying shares in AAPL is one of the best investments you could ever make honestly
2021-06-14:Sell before air comes out of whole economic mess by FED.
2021-06-14:Why does it say that fair value is 45 dollars doesn't even make sense?  I was thinking of doing some long calls for October as a long term swing should be some good returns
2021-06-14:Howdy Doody loves AAPL. But, Howdy Doody thinks Timmy is a little ---- strange.
2021-06-14:tomarrow....15 min of profit taking then heads to 134 by wednesday.people are fed up with meme stock and crypto instability and are looking for stable securities rather then get rich quick schemes

2021-06-14:Monitor for glucose is huge
2021-06-14:It’s headed to $200.
2021-06-14:The train is leaving the station. Get onboard or be confined to the sidelines throwing stones at a bullet passing train. The journey to $200 will be Swift the second half of 2021. All the planets are aligned on this one. 😎

2021-06-14:Apple own it, Don't trade it! First stock I ever bought and I plan on never selling. Going to let the dividends compound my way to early retirement!
2021-06-14:AAPL shares will be $160 a share before next earnings release. Plenty of good news are coming as well as rotation into big tech companies as well as utilization of uninvested cash sitting aside coming back into the market.
2021-06-14:any reason for this?
2021-06-14:Hold strong now...131 is the big breakout start
2021-06-14:Take solace in the fact that it finished strong 1 day out of the last 200.
2021-06-14:Hold and never sell your shares. This is the way it will reach $200 faster than if people just continue to trade it away. Don't chicken out when there's bad news. The bad days come and go. Ignore all the "noise" and remain focused.
2021-06-14:About time apple had a great day
2021-06-14:This is a bear trap nasdaq went over 14000 3 times all 3 times nasdaq tanked and apple hit 119-123 all 3 times this is a no brainer sell and buy back at 120

2021-06-14:$130 plus.  Come on Apple 🍏
2021-06-14:Not sure why it went up but I will take it
2021-06-14:SELL SELL SELL........Don't be a stupid sick freak.  The market will begin a steady 5-10% decline very soon.   Apple will fall back below $110.  Jamie Dimon says JPMorgan is hoarding cash because ‘very good chance’ inflation is here to stay
2021-06-14:Bear trap
2021-06-14:SICK FREAKS, SELL SELL SELL ABOVE $130...........The FED is going to increase interest rates this week.  It's not a matter of how much but how many times they foresee doing so in order to tame inflation.  SELL SELL SELL The market will pull back 5-10% over the coming months, Apple included.
2021-06-14:Might close in the red. This stock sucks!
2021-06-14:Of course it can't hold 130 today. Why would we get our hopes up?
2021-06-14:Sell off time?
2021-06-14:I have both AAPL and Nvidia, NVDA.I normally don't do this, but you might want to take a look at NVDA if you haven't already.It ain't cheap, but it is going to split next month. (4 to 1 )
2021-06-14:who pays $1,224.24 for an option with $580 strike price? #$%$ There are other crazy options too.
2021-06-14:Another perspective.If you believe that crypto and more specifically DeFi (decentralized finance) and blockchain based businesses are the future (and I do) then HARDWARE companies become even more valuable then they are today. Where are you going to get the machines that will do all of that processing and validation? Where are you going to get the devices to connect to these networks? Like all systems, they will need an ever growing amount of compute power (built in demand for best of breed hardware businesses).In the past, hardware businesses were a dime a dozen and valued as such. In a future where hardware is an integrated and vitally important piece to the businesses and economies of tomorrow -- Apple is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this shift, ironically BECAUSE of their hardware. Add to that a growing library of services around that essential hardware, and you have a company going from strength to strength. I remember when thinking about Apple being a $1T company was ludicrous by conventional wisdom. I remember when several people on this board laughed when I said they were on their way to $2T-$4T because of healthcare and wearables. Now imagine the value of Apple in a world dominated by technology, defi applications, and blockchain based companies that rely on hardware as the backbone to their existence. I don't think it will be long (5-10 years) before we're throwing around valuations of $5T, $10T, and perhaps more. Yes, we will have corrections in the meantime.No, stocks don't just go up. But yes, I have a strong conviction about Apple's place in the world of tomorrow.
2021-06-14:GREEN APPLE?? OMG lol
2021-06-14:Made 100$ on my Apple Call 130 today, not sure how long to hold
2021-06-14:Who’s exiting at their break even point?

2021-06-14:12 shares at $47…. Glad I bought this a few years ago. I’m new to stocks so at the time, I bought what my financial advisor told me to. I always thought expensive stocks were better but soon realized that stock price doesn’t equate to growth potential.
2021-06-14:Democrats want to break up AAPL and "Big Tech" . I'd rather see Big Government get cut in half, myself.
2021-06-14:Apple's the best around, nothings going to ever take you down.....

2021-06-14:Added 500 shares at $128.8125 for a trade, today...Long AAPL...
2021-06-14:I have posted hundreds of times on Apple since I first purchased in late 2013 to early 2014.  Today if I take into account all my purchases, stock splits and reinvested dividends I have a stock purchase price of around $30.  Today I have over 10,000 shares that I plan to let ride for many years to come.  I went into AT&T yesterday and asked the associate what percentage of their phone sales were Apple and he said at least 90%. Apple Watch and AirPods continue to dominate the wearables market and it's not even close.  Ask a teenager what type of computer they want and Apple will be the answer.  My wife has been through two PC computers in the last two years at her company.  My Apple computer is almost 6 years old and still runs like a champ!!!
2021-06-14:I thought this stock got downgraded

2021-06-14:Keep your eyes open for apples breakthrough in battery technology. I believe this will happen before the end of the year. That will be the big prize.The Apple car will come later on that will ￼just be the cherry on top of the cake.￼ I believe Apple hired￼Tesla's battery engineers around 2014 so they've been working on this quite a long time. Good luck to all longs.
2021-06-14:FANG coming back!!!  Tech will lead again
2021-06-14:I always said, "IF one person loses money, WE failed!"This is the danger. People hear that many are doing well and jump in without knowing the flip side of the coin - the dangers!Therefore, I will no longer discuss the "algorithim" Have a nice day
2021-06-14:For the security nerds like me, check out the  CUJO AI report...specifically the mobile device security section. iOS dominates Android. BGR which I typically hate because it’s ads disguised as news had a good summary article titled "iPhones dominate Android in North America, but we didn’t know it was this bad"
2021-06-14:I do not read all messages but did notice someone stating how 1'000's have lost $1.000's.Yes, the algorithim is not 100%. But it is ONLY for experienced players.Da Vinci and Van Gough has put 28% in people's pockets since Jan 2021.In early March, AAPL was $120, WE posted $140 after earnings. It printed $145.So?There must be a disconnect?
2021-06-14:Apple abandons the EV until graphene battery packs are stable and reliable-which puts it about 4 yrs out.  Tesla will have one announced later this year and will start production in Semi and Roadster 2.
2021-06-14:Apple’s wildcard, it’s suggested, is its electric vehicle’s battery. That will use what’s described as a “monocell” design, with bigger individual cells that allow the traditional pouches and modules of current EV batteries to be done away with. In the process, it’s said, that saves on space and means more power density can be squeezed into the same overall size package.Clearly, Apple is no stranger to battery technology, nor pushing its limits. Much of the company’s range relies on dense lithium-ion packs and the power management to make the most of them. An electric vehicle battery might be exponentially larger than what’s inside your iPhone 12 or your MacBook Air, but there’s nothing to say that the same efficiency processes Apple refined for those consumer products couldn’t also be brought to bear on vehicles too.The big question, then, would be why Apple might feel the need to build the car around that battery at all. If it really has nailed the next growth stage in EV power tech – something most automakers are working on, with varying degrees of success – then that would be in high demand. Rather than having to build its own vehicle, and then convince drivers to purchase that, it could license out the technology to other EV-makers wanting to extend range and reduce their costs.ADVERTISING
2021-06-14:Posted before but track this month's price action with last March, Both are last month of the quarter.Last March AAPL was $120 then made a move $145 after earnings. When it was $120 WE posted $140 after earnings. This quarter, WE are not giving the action a price target.Just be patient
2021-06-14:wish everyone an awesome rise, lucky week and great love! let's finish this week with 140+ 🍏🍏🍏🍏🚀🚀🚀🚀😊
2021-06-14:This is why I am staying with Apple stock not for the apple car but for the breakthrough in battery technology. I think you're a lot closer than people realize. Good luck to all longs.https://www.slashgear.com/if-apple-built-a-breakthrough-battery-it-doesnt-need-to-make-its-own-car-22652226/￼
2021-06-14:Muting all the bubble BS!!
2021-06-14:I don’t see inflation with the working class staying home collecting gov assistance. Chip shortages, restaurants, airlines , etc all need workers and that’s why I don’t see the economy heating up. Stocks move higher. My 2 cents

2021-06-13:Mike Lee was right last week. Money will be moving back into tech/growth. Hoping apple can lead FANG the rest of 2021.
2021-06-13:Hold on peeps.Signs are pointing to rotation out of reopening stocks and back into tech.started last week and will continue.reopening so overvalued now.tech looks cheap especially apple.no one is buying bonds,yeild is dropping so money to be made back in tech.150 by august.
2021-06-13:Looks like the tide is changing based on 10 year going lower, optimistic views about the fangs and the sell off in bee es stocks, could be time for a hard rally like l$25 move within a month!
2021-06-13:The argument that all good news is "baked in" to the price is losing merit. Apple smashed expectations the last two quarters. If they crush the next two quarters is that already built into the current price? Remember that they didn't even give guidance so how can people think everything's built in?Remember folks. People sounded the alarm during the pandemic that companies like Apple will fail. And today, as you can see by where we are, you know how that argument turned out. Losers like Rod Hall gave up and threw in the towel. The lesson to learn here is buy what you know and ignore all the "noise". Do you realize Apple has returned almost HALF A TRILLION dollars to its shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks in the span of a couple of years. What other company on this planet is mining dough like that?It's like Wall Street and institutional investors don't care that this company is becoming more and more profitable each year. It's growing its user base and expanding on product offerings. And yeah Wall Street, let's pretend like the Apple moat doesn't exist and that the M1 chip isn't revolutionary.

2021-06-12:The tax man cometh for aapl. No more stock buybacks to bet the tax man out of his cut.
2021-06-12:---Long post ahead----All right, it's time to throw down some knowledge and due diligence on these crybaby day traders who complain daily about their "bad" investment. First of all, had you INVESTED before the pandemic you would not be salty right now. Period. Be honest in admitting you didn't own shares when it doubled.Second of all, while you were still in diapers OR chasing other trades at the time, Apple actually did what's called a "stock split" on June 2014. That should have been a good reference point for you to research before you got into your trade.Since you kiddies clearly don't understand what a stock split means I suggest you read about it via Google. The split was a 7 for 1 split. Okay now go look at the historical chart. The stock price was around $20-25 in June 2014. And guess what? The stock didn't move out of that range for almost TWO years due to the dilution. It rose and fell here and there. It went to the $30s and it fell back down. It returned to the same range $20-$25 range until late July 2016. It took TWO YEARS to get out of that low for good.Fast forward two years from that to late July 2018. The price was around $47. That's almost a DOUBLE.Fast forward another two years to late July 2020 and it was at $105+. That's another DOUBLE. Facts are facts. I'm not making this up. Go look for yourself. That was a huge amount of money you could have made had you INVESTED.Where were YOU crybabies while longs were making money? In diapers or chasing bitcoin? It may be time to reevaluate whether INVESTING is the right strategy for you or if you want to continue posting nonsense each day. (From the posts we can easily distinguish investors from traders.)Now explain again why you're so butthurt about your trade? I'd say it's pretty obvious isn't it? Because you're not invested for long term. You're trying to chase quick money. Your holding period is a few days/weeks and that's the problem.Will you crybabies be the same ones who complain 5 years from now about how you "wish" you had invested?I'm long Apple with almost 8,500 shares and never selling. Apple is a long term play. Understand it. Love it. Or get out. Keep complaining about your misery while longs keep laughing at you. End of discussion.
2021-06-12:Is this a long term hold ?
2021-06-12:Our government will soon split Apple and others into two separate company’s each!  Will this be good or bad for the stock?
2021-06-12:Apple is a great company run by a good man.
2021-06-12:apple poised to break out next week
2021-06-12:down the road....if apple is required to breakup into different divisions then shareholders would get a stake in each division.a breakup could be a bonanza for shareholders...not a negitive
2021-06-12:Rounded up to 550 shares I'm done buying for a small bit. Lets see where she goes. Focusing on other positions

I just did the math. I do math 24/7 as a hobbyThe starting point was more difficult - headwind at $127 as posted at 1000 hrs.Good news is it closed above $127.Have a nice day
2021-06-11:Knowing Apple...they'll announce a date for the car and the stock will go up a buc, may even plummet...absolutely hilarious
2021-06-11:Search - House introduces 5 antitrust bills targeting apple google AmazonJust happened today and has bipartisan support.So something will be passed eventually.Surely to be big legal challenges but this time it’s real and coming not just talk.Will be awhile.But dems and republicans want it so that is not really great news.

2021-06-11:Highest Friday close since May 14th.Today like last Friday after a Thursday takedown the  algorithim play was triple digits.Look for yourselves
2021-06-11:My favorite part was when the stock went up
2021-06-11:Apple will go up when they start buying up available shares. Like by the truck loads.  Only 16B available. Lol
2021-06-11:Hoping Apple doesnt become a sideways moving stagnant stock. Prior historical inclines seem to be lacking thus far this year. Price doesnt break and remain over $135, where it should be by midyear.  Fingers crossed.
2021-06-11:Climbing higher
2021-06-11:“Anyone can give up, it's the easiest thing in the world to do. " Dear Guys, be strong and hold the 🍏🍏🍏🍏 It is going to rise, just keep calm 😊 wish happy weekend for everyone! 😊
2021-06-11:Slowly and surely it’s going to fade into close. Seems most of the pumpers have realized there are problems.
2021-06-11:Hold diamond hands
2021-06-11:Including intraday gain earlier today of 0.82%, YTD return is still <4.18%>.     The good news: the longer the base (being flat), the higher in space!     The bad news:   nobody knows exactly when it will pop.     Therefore, better to be long, than to trade AAPL.
2021-06-11:Inexplainable…but it just cannot hold anything near the daily high and always trails lower into close. See how this 30 minutes plays out. I’m guessing rinse and repeat.
2021-06-11:The move up is good, but once again AAPL does not have the volume to indicate institutional buying backing up the price change.  Today's volume is only about half of the 50-day average volume.
2021-06-11:Pray and hope it holds $1.00. LOL. I doubt it holds.

2021-06-11:Who dare be short AAPL over weekend when more EV news might emerge?
2021-06-11:AAPL have to pop above 130 in pre market on Monday. June month is full economy recovery. The same for FACEBOOK , FB have to pop above 350 by next week. FB beat earnings huge and still at this price. Expect FB to break 340 today.
2021-06-11:Outperforming all three indexes. OK....
2021-06-11:It be great if AAPL teamed up with Elon--but then what to do with Cook?
2021-06-11:AAPL $TSLA $AMZN are disruptors!  NEXT up disruptor treating Acute Pain in medical settings?  All eyes on ACRX next week, with MULTIPLE MILESTONES soon reporting...

2021-06-11:apple will succeed in design and  technology if gets in auto race
2021-06-11:Yep, this is a momentum stock. Momentum stocks do not move on fundamentals. Another sign this stock is controversial. (No real growth and the stock price quadrupling in the last two years.)
2021-06-11:Stuck at 127
2021-06-11:Argus 6/11 - The stock has had some "relative underperformance" thus far in 2021 after more than a decade of outperformance, but this is largely due to sector rotation rather than any misfires in Apple's leadership franchises.     PT of $165.
2021-06-11:6 months and no gain.. lol who talks about not trading
2021-06-11:The argument that AAPL is expensive at these levels falls apart when looking at its valuation metrics like PE, EV/EBITDA, etc. We note that since Christmas AAPL's PE has collapsed from 40 down to 28. Why? Easy. The price has remained largely stationary for the past half year, while earnings have continued to compound. Hence the E, the denominator of the PE, is increasing, while the price is remaining stationary. Hence the PE contracts. We see too that in the PEG ratio the same collapse, in fact the PEG is at a 5 year low. What does this all mean? That AAPL's earnings growth is ahead of the stock price and there is still much that the stock price hasn't reflected yet. Hence we arrive at the conclusion that AAPL is undervalued at these levels. The company is doing extremely well. Eventually the stock price will reflect this.
2021-06-11:aapl wants to break out
2021-06-11:Tom Lee has been right on the money on every prediction, now he double upgraded the FANG rally, be ready.

2021-06-11:The all day slide into the red zone.
2021-06-11:This 4:1 stock split was a terrible idea. One year later we are still in the same spot. Did aapl do the stock buyback yet. If so ... sure doesn’t seem like it. We have so many ridiculous shares outstanding.
2021-06-11:Is Buffet selling ahead of earnings?I think he knows how this is going to go.
2021-06-11:nice greenage. PUT the dollar back

2021-06-11:keep buying
2021-06-11:Everyday AAPL pops on the open then it is down, down, down for the rest of the day. Overall yes, I am long. BUT- the best way to reap short term profits in AAPL right now, is to simply short the shares on the open then buy to close at the end of the day. Then rinse & repeat. At SOME point AAPL will find it's way back into rally mode. However, when??? NOBODY knows.
2021-06-11:Algorithim players be nimble this am

2021-06-11:I am long AAPL. However, seems the best the best way to make $$$ presently is to short the shares on the open then "buy to close" at the close. It's the same pattern almost everyday. AAPL pops on the open & then it is down, down, down for the rest of the day. That said, it WILL at some point find it's way back into rally mode, the only question is WHEN?
2021-06-11:AAPL reiterated BUY and $165 price targetArgus analyst Jim Kelleher keeps his Buy rating and $165 price target on Apple following the company's WWDC event that also presented upgraded operating systems for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch. The stock has had some "relative underperformance" thus far in 2021 after more than a decade of outperformance, but this is largely due to sector rotation rather than any misfires in Apple's leadership franchises.

2021-06-11:Get ready for a wild ride!  Don't be surprised if this stock tanks down to the $30s or the $20s....but that should be OK with everybody that is Long the stock. Guys and Gals, you could have picked any stock in the Market to invest in but you chose $AMC which is a speculative stock that is subject to significant price fluctuations. Ask yourself why you chose $AMC?? You chose $AMC over stocks like $AAPL and $MSFT because you are NOT just looking for a 5% return on your investment...you are looking for a 5,000% return on your investment. Stay calm! Don't let all of the noise distract you from your objective. Just sit back and HODL your $AMC!

2021-06-10:100% chance sp500 breaks 4000 one day.
2021-06-10:Tim Cook must go , so long as he is there , this stock is not going up , now how do I know this ? Simple , no innovation

2021-06-10:keep buying shares that weak hands are selling
2021-06-10:Everyone should have opened their short positions when this hit $127.
2021-06-10:Small investors are not trading AAPL but big boys do, they buy a huge amount on red and dump on green for $1 or less up.

2021-06-10:Any AppleCar news is Rocket Fuel for the stock! 🚀🚀🚀 📈
2021-06-10:long term Apple investors have thoughts on Canoo at this juncture? Definitely seems like it would be positive for both companies to partner or merge at this point.
2021-06-10:Upon the news, this will either tease you w 127 once again...or it will continue to plummet.  Either way...
2021-06-10:Apple hires former BMW, Canoo executive for car project 2021-06-10 05:12:56 PM ET (Reuters)  June 10 (Reuters) - Apple Inc has hired Ulrich Kranz, a former senior executive at BMW AG's electric car division, to help its vehicle initiatives, Apple confirmed on Thursday.Kranz, who was most recently the chief executive of electric vehicle startup Canoo Inc, will report to Apple veteran Doug Field, who led development of Tesla Inc's mass-market Model 3 and now runs Apple's car project, the report said.The iPhone maker's automotive efforts, known as Project Titan, have proceeded unevenly since 2014 when Apple first started designing its own vehicle from scratch.In December, Reuters reported that Apple was moving forward with its self-driving car technology and targeting to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own breakthrough battery technology by 2024.-----One of these days.....TO THE MOON!
2021-06-10:Notice how the pumpers never offer any rationalization for the stocks 10 month anemic performance. That’s because they have no rationalization. They don’t know. They know something isn’t right with the performance but they have absolutely no idea why this continues to hammer downward each day.
2021-06-10:$2 trillion market cap just might be it. They aren’t valuing it higher. Obviously earnings isn’t driving the share price. So, what’s needed. My guess is new product. Since Tim isnt a product guy…I’m not sure there is anything up his sleeve. He’s no Steve Jobs.
2021-06-10:If you look at today chart, what you are seeing is a systematic selling of shares by big boys. Early pops get dropped. Like a hammer. That tells me once they on load, no amount of buying can raise the price. The buyers can’t cover the sellers. Not good.
2021-06-10:This is the best company in the whole world with the highest records. Very solid investment. It will be at least 190 $ before the end of 2021. I am very confident, and I will remind you
2021-06-10:arsseman tim must go!what has he done for apple except milking stock options?
2021-06-10:oh well, another down day for arseman
2021-06-10:My only guess is the retail investor is in the dark. There’s something going on with this stock that just isn’t right. Daily collapses. Can’t hold gains and underperforming market averages 6 of 7 days.
2021-06-10:I am sensing $AAPL would swallow $GOEV for cheap price.   It does not hurt us.  This will be huge for us
2021-06-10:Dead dog. 108 on the Nasdaq too. Can’t hold a gain and collapses during the day.
2021-06-10:Long term holder here but nothing moves this stock. Not even good news. We are all used to hearing TimCook’s BLA BLA BLA. THEN NOTHING HAPPENS. I can makeMore in a savings acct this past year
2021-06-10:Inflation means that Apples costs will go up!!!
2021-06-10:Everyday AAPL pops on the open then it is down, down, down for the rest of the day. Overall yes, I am long. BUT- the best way to reap short term profits in AAPL right now, is to simply short the shares on the open then buy to close at the end of the day. Then rinse & repeat. At SOME point AAPL will find it's way back into rally mode. However when??? NOBODY knows.
2021-06-10:$AAPL is back on the table
2021-06-10:LOL apple building a car. They will drop this like they did in 2016. Too big a project for apple.By the way didn't I read the Sony is now producing an EV.Apple best days are behind it.

2021-06-10:Nice! Apple hires BMW Exec for AppleCar program! 💥 BOOM! 💥
2021-06-10:This pathetic stock needs to sell of 20 bucks for it to move higher. The stock split ruined it. Don’t listen to all the pumpers, it’s going much lower before a meaningful move higher.
2021-06-10:Apple has gone up one dollar since the stock split in August 2020.
2021-06-10:Apple hired BMW electric car executive Ulrich Kranz, Bloomberg reportsApple (AAPL) has hired Ulrich Kranz, a former senior executive at BMW's (BMWYY) electric car division, for its own vehicle efforts, Mark Gurman of Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the situation. Apple hired Kranz in recent weeks, about a month after he stepped down as CEO of Canoo, a developer of self-driving electric vehicles, Gurman notes. He says hiring Kranz a clear sign that Apple is determined to build a self-driving electric car to rival Tesla (TSLA) and other carmakers.
2021-06-10:"Apple stock will go back up tomorrow"  says all the Apple zealots.Tomorrow:  The stock will go up next week...Next week:  It's ok, Apple will go up next month...
2021-06-10:and the biggest DOW loser is $CAT
2021-06-10:Every session, every week, every month, a recycled excuse is being peddled as to why AAPL isn’t moving — this is simply a paid component of the manipulation, right under the SEC’s noses
2021-06-10:They tested it today, pushing it down a little, but in my opinion they didn’t get the desired results and volume was lower then the average…..so it will bounce up in the next few days.
2021-06-10:Big DOW losers $GS, $JPM, and $AXP...Not $AAPL...
2021-06-10:Someone says Dead Money it looks like. NAS and most large cap tech did excellent upside winner today and AAPL is down. So lets see tha analyst is right on his price Target of $90 anytime. kAAPL is becoming more lie AT&T and PFE.
2021-06-10:I will continue buying Apple products and services because in my opinion are fantastic. I’ve owned the stock for 6 months now and haven’t even made 3%. For me I work hard for that money and 3% isn’t cutting it. Hopefully things will get better in the next few months otherwise I’ll invest in something else. Good luck to all.
2021-06-10:Well done APPL. Finally down over $1.00This is long term. I will hold. Probably will sell above $135.00
2021-06-10:this has absolutely gone nowhere since last quarters spectacular earnings. Sorry to say after all these years of owning Apple its time to say goodbye.....many other better plays out there.......bye tim cook
2021-06-10:Still holding for at least $130!
2021-06-10:then people wonder why the stock goes down day after day. More and more people are pulling out of it and going to other stocks because they are just not making any money. How can you stay in stock that makes you nothing over a year. While other stocks are producing.￼
2021-06-10:This is the most garbage stock
2021-06-10:Wow, this stock is truly the star of the day .... LOL
2021-06-10:So glad I sold I sold all my AAPL last month and distributed it evenly between FB, GOOG, and MSFT....all at all time highs btw.  Life is good folks. You should try it sometime.
2021-06-10:Longs that are frustrated you know if you sell Apple 🍏 will announce the car and the stock will soar up to $150 just your luck.  Just hold through this BS
2021-06-10:got out at 126.22 break even.
2021-06-10:Apple has underperformed this year. But watch in a blink of eyes, it will go up and you won’t know. Apple car , iPhone 13, new Mac, crypto addition.
2021-06-10:Started an upside movement. Watch it make new highs in the coming week.
2021-06-10:Hold long. Apple is due for a big run next earnings. You will see it move up big in the coming weeks. 170 is an easy target.
2021-06-10:It’s great apple supports bioweapon producing China.
2021-06-10:They're blaming bond yields for apples poor performance all year what a great lie
2021-06-10:Arguing against manipulation infers the last 3 qtrs of blowout ERs were ALL baked-in during that brief rally last August?? I find that hard to believe…
2021-06-10:Thanks Apple to keep DOW down!Please go up after 8 months.I will be waiting.
2021-06-10:get ready for a big move in appl..its going to go down faster than tim cook.
2021-06-10:Everyone throwing out dumb reasons why AAPL hasn’t moved much. Stocks go through lulls all the time. AAPL had a big run up prior to split. It had its biggest quarter ever but it didn’t move. Hedge funds always watch AAPL. If it doesn’t move then they concentrate on spending money elsewhere usually riskier bets and manipulators are keeping the price low shaking out the weak investors. Then at the end of the year the stock starts to make its move usually because the quarters are good and the new products are announced. Everyone wonders why then the price action moves. When Apple starts moving up 3-5 dollars you’ll see more institutions and hedge funds pile in.
2021-06-10:If mms wants any stock down regardless of how overall Mkt in green …they will keep it down . They are in control!
2021-06-10:I Must admit I have never seen this pattern with Apple !! Down up market days, ALOT... This is concerning , plenty of people say when you least expect it this will run , but it has not happened
2021-06-10:I am taking a shot at a pure casino play with apple  call options 127 for .25 expiring tomorrow.
2021-06-10:Only way to beat this collusion or what ever u call it is to stay long!!
2021-06-10:Still a mystery why AAPL is still the most optioned stock on the exchange after 10 months, when retail longs have proven not enough buying power to drive shareprice against majority-held institutions, who own as many as they ever will…and still option players line up to be suckered…
2021-06-10:If you invested in apple in 2021 you would be down -5% it has not been a good year so far for tech
2021-06-10:down again NASDAQ up😆😆😆￼￼

2021-06-10:Seems to be very little interest in Apple…..
2021-06-10:Web3 will finish off Apple! Ankr
2021-06-10:Look for the PRICE to SPRINT HIGHER in the very, very near future:Options CALL BUYS from Benzinga:"On Thursday morning, Apple made another attempt to break out but weakness in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) caused Apple’s stock to drop back below its overhead resistance level. Despite the uncertainty, Apple options traders purchased call contracts consistently throughout the morning.Why It’s Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating an imminent large move in stock price. A sweeper pays market price for the call option instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately.These types of call option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates “smart money” has entered into a position."
2021-06-10:Bought more here. Accumuating. Hedgies game will end soon and some of them will get burn.  EPS/revenues are leading factors. AAPL EPS/revenues on Q43, Q4, Q1 even high eps. buy and accumulate. The more we buy and hold the more explosive the short squeeze
2021-06-10:Just ongoing proof that no matter how the market is performing, the big holders of AAPL can leverage their sizable position to wash trade up to 50M shares to pin shareprice, ensuring their premium income from the calls expiring worthless tomorrow
2021-06-10:AAPL needs a reverse split 1 for 2 =252.00 share at that still behind many of the big boys in price.
2021-06-10:Apple is a prime example for the market! Before a big fall Apple will drop first then the market will follow. You will see the market will drop big this week or next week
2021-06-10:To everything but apple is going to pop today?
2021-06-10:This is absurd. It’s a perfect green day. We could have been at $130 :/ lame! Underperforming against peers as usual.
2021-06-10:DO NOT BUY THE US STOCKS IN THIS TULIP MANIA BUBBLE!!! The valuations are ABSURD!!!Nasdaq Composite the MEGA BUBBLE will COLLAPSE BIG TIME!!!Inflation is skyrocketing!!!$AAPL $JPM $TSLA

2021-06-10:AAPL down  4+% so far this year.  Want to make a guess how big that number would be if they didn't have blow-out quarterly numbers?  You wouldn't take a haircut, you would be scalped!!
2021-06-10:Nothing but selling..question is...who???
2021-06-10:Anyone gambling for tomorrow options expiration can get real cheap options that expire tomorrow. Pure gambling but the last 2 expirations have paid off nicely with call buying on Thursday near end of day.
2021-06-10:Tim Cook must resign n new innovations are long overdue.

2021-06-10:HERE'S THE FUTURE.Only Tesla will have the manufacturing prowess to produce many millions of EVs  per year & Tesla's superior 4680 cell will guarantee their $AAPL esque marketshare position.  Just 5million cars per year times 50k avg price equals an insane 250Billion per year in revenues and 10s of billions per year in net profits.    The market will realize this a little before the 4680 fabs begin production and that is when Tesla breaks out again to new highs and when Elon becomes the richest person on the planet permanently. Just telling you the future.

2021-06-10:SellYou don't have to suffer to enrich Tim Cook and his buddies.They are using your hard-earned money to increase the value of their stock options.

2021-06-10:this is one of those prices that's hovered so long here for such a long time and screams undervalued.  120-130 for months now, seems like such an obvious buy at this price.  once it rips upward wildly we'll all say...jeez, I knew that!!

2021-06-10:well here it goers folks, apple slipping already so it is the 127 is too much for apple to hold, and the sell analyst prove to be correct
2021-06-09:Making this twink the CEO of Apple was one of my Master’s greatest pranks, Satan really does have a wonderful sense of humor.
2021-06-09:The 'ol 127 head fake
2021-06-09:Apple was bad even when Steve jobs was alive. now its a complete comedy show with clown audience
2021-06-09:EV's are failures, just check the amount being released ! some people do refuse to be fooled twice !
2021-06-09:Apple's Titan now talked about for almost a decade newly named Apple's Lilliputian.It doesn't seem like Apple has a clear concept on any of the details of this venture.It could be a big project it could be cut back to a sliver of the original concept. My God Apple get a clue you look foolish as a company.
2021-06-09:America at the G7
2021-06-09:Omg apple is performing so well since January 20th! You must be proud Zzzzzzzs
2021-06-09:$WIMI Can’t ask for a better future growth company , it’s just getting started as tech improves it will just snowball in a 10 billion $ company and incredibly fast . My # 1 holding hands down 💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎$SQ $AAPL $TSLA
2021-06-09:Green Day!
2021-06-09:CPI is going yo surprise and either way market will be up either tomorrow or Friday or both!
2021-06-09:No WWDC bump?
2021-06-09:Apple's first AR headset will launch in the second quarter of 2022.
2021-06-09:WIMI is up more than 10% for the third day in a row, is this because $AAPL is releasing an AR product?
2021-06-09:what ever I invest in I buy in as well. looks like i’m done buying apple products
2021-06-09:What game is the market makers and traders playing pinning the stock at 127 it's not even tradable anymore what's going on here is it poised to jump higher or they going to sink it
2021-06-09:NOBODY needs "fakebook"!
2021-06-09:up day in a down market. NOT BAD
2021-06-09:An interesting point. Everyone has seen the drones. I’ve seen a video of drone “vehicles” . I think that is what’s coming. That would redefine the word innovation.
2021-06-09:Timmy Cook, you putz you, finish up your buybacks and announce the iCar!
2021-06-09:Apple messed up facebooks business model.Facebook wants revenge.Facebook will fail because no one wants to give up privacy and confidentiality so Facebook can make more money from selling your info to the highest bidder
2021-06-09:aapl seems.to be inversely.affected compared to other stocks,every other Tech stock is red except apple
2021-06-09:It's been official for some months, but today's action confirms that AAPL is a momentum stock. Momentum stocks often buck the trend in the general market. Today's up finish does not guarantee in any way tomorrow if the general market rises, AAPL will rise.
2021-06-09:.37% hahah what a joke
2021-06-09:Over 1.50 percent raise in the last 5 business trading days. Apple has awoken
2021-06-09:not going to be sarcastic  like so many we ended green but not enough to off set my CAT and HD lossesholding long  and strong
2021-06-09:I'm surprised it even closed green today.
2021-06-09:The graph looks lately like market has an E.D.
2021-06-09:Well, maybe a little green or a little red. Most are watching for the financial reports tomorrow. That’s my guess.
2021-06-09:apple are you listening? your investors are not happyno returns for almost a year.
2021-06-09:If you're looking for some action, you've come to the wrong place...........
2021-06-09:hold it, believe in 🍏🍏🍏🍏 be strong 🍏
2021-06-09:Told you it wasn’t going to hold. Never does. This stock has a new name. It’s no longer Apple. It’s “Dump into close.”
2021-06-09:10 year bond down low…. this should be up 5…. something definitely wrong
2021-06-09:Not going to hold this level by close. Sorry.
2021-06-09:Rough end of the day coming….
2021-06-09:The moves are like a tortoise. Jeez. Get moving.
2021-06-09:mega cap growth stocks have had a great run this week, better check the greed and book profit now
2021-06-09:I think the days are over of seeing healthy $3 to $5 Green Day’s are over. Seems to have settled into small moves.
2021-06-09:Apple is starting to melt up.  Just like it’s last big run!
2021-06-09:I did my part to make the share price go up today. I purchased a new iPad Pro. Shockingly, I paid $2,100 and there is NO headphone jack.  Remember, many airlines do not permit Bluetooth. Also when watching a movie with my wife we like to share 2 headphones. Possible to do with Bluetooth, but difficult and limited. Oh well, another "Bag of Dongle's and Adapters"  for my newest Apple product.
2021-06-09:$nio, $tsla, $aapl, and pltr, $ccl, $dis, Should I sell PLTR now and buy back cheaper tomorrow after the market tanks due to horrible CPI data? But, I will be paying about 30% tax on short term gain which would come  to the loss we will have tomorrow. So it may even out...I do not know..but if PLTR tanks more that I can come out positive
2021-06-09:I can see it now. “Other car manufacturers have shied away from safety. They mention a few minor safety features here or there, but they don’t want to face the grim truth of how dangerous their car can be to you and others under the wrong conditions— conditions that arise every day for thousands of drivers. We decided it was time someone faced up to this and did something about it. We decided it was time to bring car safety into the 21st century.”*thunderous applause followed by every other car manufacturer scrambling to catch up for the next five years*
2021-06-09:That’s it Tim Cook has done it again , nearly  one year worth of stagnant stock price
2021-06-09:Guys, help!$nio, $tsla, $aapl, and pltrI know that the CPI data will be horrible as we all know everything went up crazy. I am paying $29-30 for steak at a grocery that I used to pay $14-16 last year. Yes, we all see the rise in our grocery bill. Therefore, should I sell PLTR and apple today   KNOWING it will tank tomorrow and pick them up cheap tomorrow. I have made over $15K with aapl and pltr within a month. Tesla and NIO are for long term.
2021-06-09:apple will never rally again.  the stock has peaked.  look for alternative investments in Google,  Facebook, nvidia and Microsoft.
2021-06-09:Tight ranges. Good or bad?
2021-06-09:When this wakes up its going to be fun and it will at some point, so be ready for good days!
2021-06-09:Another nothing day, nothing week, nothing month, nothing year. Thanks for nothing AAPL.
2021-06-09:Share price was higher 10.5 months ago, Aug 31, 2020.  Long and almost patient…

2021-06-09:At last ! It has awaken
2021-06-09:About to breakout...........................
2021-06-09:amc,,,gme..clov have took over the market…it a new day..i own apple since..2014…what else can i say…
2021-06-09:Blinding gains today. Must be all the new innovations.  Lol
2021-06-09:Apple is doing amazing things that no one else is doing with their mobile and stationary platforms folks.Couple that with the fact that Apple silicon is unique and way ahead of the competition and you get the point.I think they will easily claim Health, VR, Home automation, EV automation, Audio/video streaming, Gaming and much more...If Apple were to release a HomeServer as was leaked recently, every developer would flock to develop applications for it.  From there, the could actually leap onto the corporate arena and make major gains on corporate networks just like they did with the iPhone and iPads.What they are doing with their API is out this world.  We're talking Star Trek technology.  Beam me up Scotty!!Go Apple go go go!
2021-06-09:Everyone laughed at me when I said IBM is a better play than Apple guess what IBM's up 30 points in the past 2 months
2021-06-09:Stock has been stagnant close to a year now.
2021-06-09:What a boring day ..nothing trade able today with apple...the range is too small and there is no run to it
2021-06-09:What does seriously oversold mean?
2021-06-09:At least Tim Cook pay tax. He won’t make up lies. Apple develops software, chips and hardware that benefits is in a long term. Just saying.
2021-06-09:I want to say something about this stonk but i rather not 🤣🤣🤣
2021-06-09:we need to get thru 128s
2021-06-09:The excuse for tech stocks trading flat to down has been 10 year yields going up. Now it’s at 1.50 and tech is doing nothing. Why?
2021-06-09:The most manipulated stock is at it again.. breaking through 127 is like pulling teeth.
2021-06-09:Time to buy its now ! Finally awoken after one year slumber
2021-06-09:Sorry to say, this will never ever breakout and fly up again because it would be forced to split up into 50 Billion shares...and thats never gonna happen
2021-06-09:Backed into the 127 tease yet again...
2021-06-09:Hey G  The definition of a Growth Stock is a company with super topline growth and the company ploughs the profits back into itself to foster that growth.Companies with nice dividends have past their peak and so distribute money to the investors in the form of dividends.So, what do you want AAPL to be?
2021-06-09:high of 127. 75?  she crawling back?
2021-06-09:apple should be the best div stock  in the dow. it should raise the div and make it the number one stock to own.
2021-06-09:Close at $125.50
2021-06-09:All in.

2021-06-09:well... I made a mistake investing in apple 🤷‍♀️
2021-06-09:What is the story with Google and Facebook? how can they go up everyday even in a bad market!
2021-06-09:AAPL is leading the whole market . . . down.

2021-06-09:Apple to the moon. Lynchfauci!
2021-06-09:TECH IS KING..and AAPL will lead the pack!!!
2021-06-09:Apple Car and Mixed Reality are on deck. It’s happening soon enough. All the patents, leaks, interviews, govt permits etc confirm it. Just a matter of time. Meanwhile Apple keeps improving its current amazing ecosystem. It’s a consumer staple now without a doubt.
2021-06-09:Apple making product in a country that declares biowarfare in the world.
2021-06-09:$WIMI The untapped potential for growth , the options are endless for revenue on this platform again as I stated before it’s a 10 billion $ company and in very short order .$FB $AAPL $TSLA
2021-06-09:$WIMI $AMZN $AAPL This makes sense to me.
2021-06-09:I guess I should have held, on.👾
2021-06-09:I just loaded up on Genisis energy LP symbol GEL the company is the leaders in soda ash which is needed to make solar glass, lithium batteries,insulation,all cleaning materials and the list goes on and on concrete.
2021-06-08:The Apple Car is still a ways off, but I'm expecting at least a public announcement soon with a full reveal further down the line, possibly next year. Just wanted to share my thoughts on a few things.I see the Apple Car as a culmination of all the latest tech and software development that Apple has made. We'll see AI integration of some sort of course which makes sense considering Apple acquired Vilynx and a couple of other names some time ago. Then look at the M1 chip - it's currently used in macs and ipads but will no doubt be integrated to some extent because it has the neural engine. That's basically a whole chip devoted to handling machine learning which is a perfect fit for AI and self driving.I can also see Siri integration of some sort. Just talk to the car and give it commands. It'll play the radio on the fly, make calls hands-free, listen to the local news or weather, stuff like that.I also expect Apple to tell us about the car battery and what makes it unique relative to other competitors like Tesla. There were some news articles a few months ago that I recall commented about how some sort of battery breakthrough.
2021-06-08:break $128.58 and this will run. should rally hard before Aug at latest, most likely in the next month. failure to break key resistance may signal down trend despite recent higher lows
2021-06-08:Loool +0.67 % 😂😂
2021-06-08:$WIMI $FB $AAPL Is a solid play, I thought today was a big move.
2021-06-08:Still have my AAPL (five years running) but, there is an old saying any intelligent person understands: “Never get married to a stock”. Life is change.
2021-06-08:An amazing group of people . You live between the glory and the flame. Hold and prosper, sell and lose. Choose your horse and then....ride it till it drops.
2021-06-08:As in the past, up $3.50 at intra day high from yesterday's low. In "algorithim terms?let's have a look. Yesterday the $125 calls closed at $1.80. 0946 AAPL printed $128,46...Easy 150% counting premium. $125 puts were down 50%...200%Let's review the algorithim game book. A stockk $1.50 from open after open rally then run the stock $3.50.Look at the historical prices the pat few days then later to confirm this.now! WE posted $129 by Friday. WE should have not. Traders will sit just shy of $129 like they did today at $128,46. WE are taking it back. now! $129 if not this week soonWhy everyone can not work together is a mystery to me
2021-06-08:Get YourAz To Work, Vacation is over.We are living proof that there is no one-size-fits-all policy for people. For Inclusion and Diversity to work, we have to recognize how different we all are, and with those differences, come different needs and different ways to thrive. We feel that Apple has both the responsibility to recognize these differences, as well as the capability to fully embrace them.
2021-06-08:Shorts are desperate.they have to scrape the bottom to find something wrong with Apple....look for more steady gains
2021-06-08:The software upgrades shown at WWDC were a clear indicator that Apple is taking the battle to Facebook and Zoom with networking tools. In the end, this will translate to more users and eventually...more revenue. What's not to love? Competition is healthy. It keeps companies in check and the public decides who's successful and not based on their preferences. Giving users a choice is always a plus in my book and I'm sure users will appreciate Apple's stance on privacy first for its user base.As a shareholder, seeing how the company cares about its users and puts this plan into action says a lot about Apple and company management. Way to go Tim! Long Apple.
2021-06-08:This stock market is out of control with SEC and DOJ running in circles like chickens without heads. Can anyone run a TA analysis on equity CLOV's massive gain of 85% in a day joining such equities as GME, AMC...etc?
2021-06-08:Flat Monday Tuesday. Up Wednesday Thursday. Flat Friday. Same cycle.
2021-06-08:Here is my 2 cents worth , yes Apple is my worst performer this year , maybe because I kept adding shares from 116 to 119 building my position out , I am still up 7% and I will take that for now and be happy
2021-06-08:Can’t stress this enough waiting for the price of apple to go down before you buy will almost always cost you. You’ll wait and wait and it’ll either not go down enough for you, stay flat, and then inevitably go up — and all you’ll have to show for it is some cash that can now buy you fewer and fewer shares of apple.
2021-06-08:Just a day trade right now….
2021-06-08:One day not in the far distance the reddit bee es is going to fall apart, its not a matter of if but when! Its going to be ugly.
2021-06-08:GME WISH, AMC, CLOV,,,all far better to make money then apple, apple is safer but no run to make cash
2021-06-08:Weakness starts after 4 pm...just like clock work
2021-06-08:Alert the media, it finished
2021-06-08:This thing can’t hold a hand…let alone a gain.
2021-06-08:What a joke
2021-06-08:Someone pulled a trigger because this dropped 25 cents instantly.
2021-06-08:RIDE will be bought out by $aapl or $tsla, $gm or $f, or $nio
2021-06-08:WWDC I guess Mikey liked it.
2021-06-08:Hopefully we can close with a +$1 gain
2021-06-08:Looks like it will dump at the 10 minute mark.
2021-06-08:Doesn’t look like a strong close.
2021-06-08:9 months of doing nothing. Bumstock
2021-06-08:Let’s see if woof woof can hold $127.
2021-06-08:$BB $AAPL millionaires, here we go again with ACRX!!  ACRX just went **PARABOLIC** now up about 65% in 30 days & counting...  ACRX upcoming milestones could = 1,000% UPSIDE by December 31, 2021!Still think $TSLA will buy either $PLUG or $CLNE
2021-06-08:Crucial 127.  Point
2021-06-08:Go apple!!!
2021-06-08:Me am think AAPL will buy FORD to keep up with their 2025 EV forecast and promise to their shareholders. Jmho.Cheers
2021-06-08:What the analysts are saying about Apple’s WWDC 21
2021-06-08:Sold my 1200 shares of AAPL an hour ago after months of a big nothing-burger... since then up $1.00.  bahahahahaha... Want to see it drop instantly again?
2021-06-08:Both averages green. You want to see a strong finish.
2021-06-08:128 is a pretty strong resistant level. AAPL needs to close above it in other to move forward.
2021-06-08:I predict that TD101 will not offer predictions today. He never does on green days
2021-06-08:What do you say longs closing above $128
2021-06-08:Apple trying to break up out of massive head and shoulder formation. I think it will because it’s all about helicopter money crushing the shorts.
2021-06-08:Anyone getting worried about ransomware and encryption technology in post-quantum cyber security ... OONEF has patented unbreakable cyber security... earnings out Thursday before market open ... throw some bucks at it ... 28 cents a share today
2021-06-08:...up right now 3 times more than the Nasdaq right now....Ignore the Haters...
2021-06-08:Should eventually pick up. PE is low compared to peers atm
2021-06-08:I think the market goes parabolic like dog coin did. The fed about to print another couple trillion. We will all have millions work or no work, but the price of bread maybe cost a thousand.
2021-06-08:darn, it would appear as though Apple had it's day when it was at the forefront of technological advancement. now there is a long list of competitors manufacturing comparable products. there's nothing fresh about this Apple and consumers know it. the old school longs will disagree. they're sitting on profits hoping for more but I think it's probably stale.
2021-06-08:if there is low inflation, market heads higher. if there is inflation, Fed will say it's temporary and market will head higher.
2021-06-08:Better off day trading AAPL...
2021-06-08:I be buying once it goes back under $126
2021-06-08:hot stock market. down days are few and just another buying opporunity.
2021-06-08:For a short time today, I saw 127 and it made me feel good.
2021-06-08:Technical are looking weak for Apple over a long term perspective. Just chart this out on a weekly/monthly basis.
2021-06-08:Here comes the 127 tease...followed by the continued plummet
2021-06-08:The week is young.Be patient
2021-06-08:Typical apple excrement. Giving back everything. Time for the manlover to be shown the door
2021-06-08:At 0946 hrs, AAPL printed $128.46. Up $2.54Algorithim players did okay...triple digits.AAPL should hit $129 this weekWE posted $3+...
2021-06-08:This stock should have been trading from 140-160 months ago. Maybe the company is buying up the shares slowly at these low prices and torturing the long term shareholders for our own good. This has been dead money for the past 12-18 months. I hope that I am correct
2021-06-08:The underlying economy is debt bloated and slow growth deflationary.The fed has exhausted the low rate policy to buy deflating assets, zero down, zero rate loans. Now they will try to inflate out of the debt bubble. Prices higher, rates higher, but no debt deflation depression. So stagflation is the new policy vs deflation depression. Income inequality was much better in the 70’s because stocks got 7 PE’s for growth.
2021-06-08:“Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from TF Securities has said that Apple will launch its augmented reality head-mounted display in the second quarter of 2022, meaning that it is just one year away. This would be the first major new Apple product line to be released since Apple introduced the Apple Watch in 2015”
2021-06-08:I am a long time holder but can you just imagine if this drops into the red today. I will always be a long time older but some of this stuff I just can’t comprehend!!!!
2021-06-08:Tim has been wasting the company's money on stock buyback programs so that his stock options will go up. He will retire enormously wealthy thanks to the sweat and blood of millions of retirees who believed money can keep growing on trees.
2021-06-08:stay cool...
2021-06-08:I would sell at breakeven but I’m at 134 , which I doubt I will see in this life again , Tim Cook must go n apple needs new innovations not just some updates to iOS 15
2021-06-08:Entire Nasdaq just cooled off
2021-06-08:The world's best divestment idea for the next 3~5 years.A 90% decline from its all time high.
2021-06-08:It looks like it’s heading downstairs
2021-06-08:Apple stock is pathetic, just need to breakeven at 132
2021-06-08:Almost the entire tech market I’m watching just turned red, except for AAPL, AMZN, and maybe GOOG. You naysayers have to take a break from the Apple tunnel vision sometimes—“you don’t have to be a preak everyday of your life you know”
2021-06-08:I looked at the chart for today....I remember this ride at Hershey Park...its called Storm runner...You go straight up...then some up and downs and then you vomit.
2021-06-08:Where is the bottom?$14 and change. After a nice 90% haircut.

2021-06-08:AAPL reiterated outperform with a $185 price target at WedbushWedbush analyst Daniel Ives notes that as usual for Apple's (AAPL)WWDC, all eyes were on iOS upgrades and software enhancements for the coming year as developers are "eagerly awaiting" the next software improvements to come out of Cupertino with surprisingly no new product introduction on the Mac front as part of the festivities. iOS 15 was introduced and is very focused around new device privacy protections, various notifications/lock screen changes, and a revamped iMessage feature set, Ives adds. The analyst points out that this follows the iOS 14.5 release which has doubled down on privacy features for the consumer at a time which Apple has directly put itself on a collision course with Facebook (FB) around the ability for users to block data tracking. Data privacy and security were a main focus and theme of the keynote as Apple solidifies its privacy policy with the iOS 15 unveil, he highlights. The analyst has an Outperform rating and a price target of $185 on Apple's shares.
2021-06-08:AAPL reiterated overweight with a $161 price target at Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said some of the highlights of Apple's WWDC 2021 included new work and learn from home enablers, advanced AI/ML capabilities, a strengthening of Apple's health platform, and new "privacy enablers." Following the software-focused keynote, Huberty argues that new software updates, combined with new hardware launches later this summer and fall, will allow Apple to see a third consecutive year of growth in FY22. What Huberty said "remains clear" after the first day of the event is that "Apple's vertically integrated ecosystem of world-class hardware, software, and industry-leading services remains a key point of differentiation that competitors cannot replicate," the analyst tells investors. She maintains an Overweight rating and $161 price target on Apple shares.
2021-06-08:Yesterday's dip in am, after hours and now pre-market action suggest "algorithim players" are here.There will be a gap at the open I bet. Wether or not it gathers momentum is the $64,000 question.They can be a  very nimble crowd
2021-06-08:Every time people say this stock is overpriced, it inevitably climbs higher. Maybe it’s a few weeks later, maybe it’s a few months, but always, always, always, the price climbs higher because apple is an incredible company with incredible talent, products, and a knack for innovations that actually matter to people as opposed to just for the sake of it. A lot of people have a hard time with that last one, they think because the iPhone doesn’t have a jet pack built into it yet apple has lost its edge. Apple’s edge is in putting its focus toward what people will actually buy and use, not what sounds cool and makes tech enthusiast headlines then fizzles into the ether. Those who understand how apple operates will continue to hold and get rich while those who confuse apple with every other company out there will continue to sell and short and stress over all the money they’re losing. Which do you want to be?
2021-06-08:Nobody cares if AAPL is strong in premarket trading anymore.

2021-06-08:SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Apple Inc is in early-stage talks with China's CATL and BYD about the supply of batteries for its planned electric vehicle, four people with knowledge of the matter said.Apple has made building manufacturing facilities in the United States a condition for potential battery suppliers, said two of the sources.Apple is in favor of using lithium iron phosphate batteries that are cheaper to produce because they use iron instead of nickel and cobalt which are more expensive, the four people said.

2021-06-07:Apple is looking out for we the people, I command them. Giving us a choice to not be tracked unless we want to be is incredible.But we still have Chinese communist owned companies like Epic trying to be greedy and gain access to Apple users for free.Disgusting to the core.

2021-06-07:Dan Ives is right. Apple stock is heading to the MOON. You cant get to the moon unless you sit down and strap yourselves in boys and girls. But before it gets there, it will get to $250 first. Apple longs will see the fruits of their investment with due time. Their patience will be rewarded while desperate traders will continue to complain about how terrible the daily/weekly returns are.
2021-06-07:What Apple employees are really asking for is the employee-discounted Apple car, in order to get to the office…or even better, the Apple AR headset, in order to collaborate with teammates virtually…your cue, Tim

2021-06-07:Apple can't even get something as simple as screen brightness on their phones right, even after all these years.  What does that say-when you've barely changed the appearance for a decade and it's still messed up?
2021-06-07:IBD did say if AAPL can break out over $130 that we could have a run.
2021-06-07:BB to the moon.....Get out of Apple and get in to BB.  Still have a chance.

Let's eat their lunch and expand on the Apple ecosystem. People sleep on the details like this and then are shocked when record revenues are recorded. Own it don't trade it.
2021-06-07:I see we had a good day in tech stocks - uh - except for AAPL.
2021-06-07:Longs' psyche will be crushed because they think this stock will recover. (Deep inside, though, they all know that's a pipe dream.)

2021-06-07:What a big move today for apple

2021-06-07:Oh my did you people watched Reports on CNBC this morning about Apple?    They don’t see this going over 130 anytime soon  we’re talking months￼￼.
2021-06-07:apple is sooooo trashhhhhhh
2021-06-07:WWDC did absolutely nothing to boost the stock.
2021-06-07:Typical Apple.  They say "we want to protect your privacy from 3rd party developers..." but not from Apple.  They'll still collect your information and sell it to 3rd party developers.  It's nothing altruistic.  It's a power grab.  Look past their fake facade and to you'll see the true Apple.
2021-06-07:Apple has a worm in it!  It looks sick and getting ready to bust 125 on the downside on its way to 100.

2021-06-07:The more people insult this stock, the more shares I want to own.
2021-06-07:I think VIX going to go up like AMC The market is massively overvalued propped up by free money.
2021-06-07:The fact AAPL bears exist makes me want to lol. Shorts have made so little compared to long's off AAPL...you're literally talking about since 2009 AAPL having gains outnumbering losses by a ratio of 99 to 1. The company may be at a standstill as of recently but only a fool thinks that is permanent. This company is still undervalued at these levels. From a historical perspective the company's PEG ratio is at a 5 year low, and the PE and growth rate stack up very reasonably towards one another. Those of you unwilling to wait for the future returns are selling yourselves short. This company until half a year ago was in a mostly uninterrupted run higher dating back since 12 years ago. Boo hoo, it hasn't done anything in 6 months, I wanna sell and attack others who think this is permanent. The shorts have no vision, as do the weak hands. Hold for the long term. This is not the top. The most recent quarters tell you the underlying business is excellent. The stock price is a lagging indicator of the company's success.
